Introduction
</span>
    </h2>
<p>
    The design and construction of architectures having properties useful for the practical applications as molecular sensors, luminescent materials, as well as in catalysis, adsorption, gas storage, and so on, hold a prominent place in supramolecular chemistry.<a href="#cit1"><sup>1</sup></a> The use of metal ions and organic ligands for the preparation of hybrid metal–organic frameworks has considerable promise for designing such materials. Since the triply charged yttrium cation belongs to hard acids in terms of the HSAB concept, ligands containing hard donor atoms (N, O) or acido ligands (halides, pseudohalides) are preferable for this cation. The large ionic radius of Y<sup>3+</sup> combined with the predominantly electrostatic nature of the metal–ligand binding is responsible for the formation of compounds with coordination number (CN) from 4 to 9. The coordination and structural diversity of yttrium compounds are considered in detail in the review.<a href="#cit2"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p><p>
    Aromatic nitrogen heterocycles play a key role in the self-organization and design of macromolecular architectures. 4,4′-Bipyridine (bpy) is most commonly used in this area. This compound (1) is a ditopic ligand and can bridge between metal centers, (2) in the protonated form, can act as a counterion, (3) can serve as a guest occupying cavities in the structure, or (4) can be coordinated to a metal ion in a monodentate fashion. For example, in the structure of [Y(crot)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)(bpy)<sub>1/2</sub>]<sub><em>n</em></sub>, bpy molecules act as bidentate-bridging ligands and link dimeric yttrium polyhedra (CN 9) coordinated by chelating and bridging crotonate anions to form polymer chains.<a href="#cit3"><sup>3</sup></a> The structure of [Y(nip)<sub>2</sub>][H<sub>2</sub>(bpy)]<sub>0.5</sub> (H<sub>2</sub>nip is 5-nitroisophthalic acid) contains 1-D chains Y–O–C–O–Y linked by carboxylate ligands to form layers, wherein protonated diimine is not involved in the coordination and is located between the layers.<a href="#cit4"><sup>4</sup></a> In the dimeric compound [Y<sub>2</sub>(Hca)<sub>6</sub>(bpy)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]·2bpy, where H<sub>2</sub>ca is 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, the dimerization occurs <em>via</em> carboxylate groups of Hca. These groups link two yttrium polyhedra (CN 8); one bpy molecule in each polyhedron is coordinated in a monodentate fashion and two other bpy molecules are in the solvation sphere. In this assembly, hydrogen bonds play a key role in the formation of a 3D supramolecular framework.<a href="#cit5"><sup>5</sup></a> The supramolecular aggregation based on hydrogen bonding is typical also of the assembly [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·1.5(18-crown-6), which was synthesized by the reaction of [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O with 18-crown-6 in methanol.<a href="#cit6"><sup>6</sup></a> The changes in the reaction conditions or the use of alternative solvent systems promote the appearance of new forms, and secondary interactions give rise to unusual and interesting structural motifs and polynuclear assemblies.<a href="#cit2"><sup>2,6</sup></a>
</p><p>
    It is known that the photoluminescence of metal thiocyanate complexes is due to fluorescence of the thiocyanate ion.<a href="#cit7"><sup>7</sup></a> In assemblies with organic ligands, particularly, in those containing nitrogen-containing aromatic linkers, the fluorescence can be centered on organic linkers acting as antennas. Studies on the luminescence properties of d-metal thiocyanate complexes are scarce.<a href="#cit8"><sup>8,9</sup></a> The emission spectra of KSCN and the complex [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O were broad and almost unstructured.<a href="#cit7"><sup>7</sup></a> This suggests that the S<sub>1</sub> → S<sub>0</sub> fluorescence of the SCN<sup>−</sup> ion plays a key role in the luminescence of the complex [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O. In the luminescence spectra of complexes, the emission band is usually associated with the transition of the molecule from the excited (S<sub>1</sub>) state to the ground state (S<sub>0</sub>). Fluorescence is determined by the following factors: (1) the nature of the central atom (metal), (2) the nature of the organic ligand, and (3) the molecular packing in the structure. It was of interest to investigate the effect of bipyridine on the fluorescence of thiocyanate supramolecular assemblies <strong>1–3</strong>.
</p><p>
    In the present study, we investigated the reaction of yttrium thiocyanate [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O with bpy in a series of solvents, and isolated [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>EtOH(bpy)(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·bpy (<strong>1</strong>) from ethanol, {(μ-bpy)[Y(NCS)<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub>}·3bpy·2(i-PrOH) (<strong>2</strong>) and {Hbpy}<sub>2</sub>{(μ-bpy)[Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>(NCS)<sub>4</sub>]<sub>2</sub>}·bpy (<strong>3</strong>) from i-PrOH and from solutions in MeCN and THF. The assemblies were identified by X-ray diffraction. Their thermochemical behavior was studied, and the photoluminescent characteristics were determined.

Results and discussion
</span>
    </h2>
<p>
    Self-assembly of the metal salts with bridging 4,4′-bipyridine (bpy) leads to dimeric or polymeric compounds. Supramolecular ensembles appear as a result of noncovalent binding, hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking or outer-sphere interactions of ligands with metal complexes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of medium (the nature of the solvent, pH, ratio of reagents) in aggregation of yttrium thiocyanate complexes with bpy. This implied the synthesis of supramolecular ensembles, reveal the influence of association and polymerization on structural feature ensembles.

    The reaction of yttrium thiocyanate with bpy in EtOH affords [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>EtOH(bpy)(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·bpy (<strong>1</strong>). Compound <strong>1</strong> with the ratio bpy : Y = 2 was isolated from ethanolic solutions, in which the initial bpy : Y ratio varied from 1 to 4; an increase in the ratio results in a decrease in the purity of the product. Pure <strong>1</strong> (X-ray powder diffraction) was obtained from a solution with the ratio bpy : Y = 2. A relatively low yield (∼50%) is attributed to high solubility of <strong>1</strong> in ethanol. In assembly <strong>1</strong>, one bpy molecule is coordinated in a monodentate fashion, whereas another bpy is a molecule of solvation. It is interesting that it is the bpy molecule rather than protolytic H<sub>2</sub>O or EtOH molecules that is present in the solvation sphere. The assembly {(μ-bpy)[Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub>}·3bpy·2(i-PrOH) (<strong>2</strong>) was synthesized according to the following two procedures: by the treatment of <strong>1</strong> with i-PrOH (synthesis A) or by the direct reaction of yttrium thiocyanate with bpy in i-PrOH (synthesis B). The formation of <strong>2</strong> can be considered as the dimerization of <strong>1</strong> accompanied by elimination of EtOH from the coordination sphere and the change in the coordination mode of the bpy ligand from monodentate to bridging. It is noteworthy that the supramolecular assembly <strong>2</strong> contains two i-PrOH molecules along with three bpy molecules in the solvation sphere. It should be emphasized that the anionic dimeric assembly [Hbpy]<sub>2</sub>{(μ-bpy)[Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>(NCS)<sub>4</sub>]<sub>2</sub>}·bpy (<strong>3</strong>) was detected (X-ray powder diffraction) in i-PrOH regardless of the bpy : Y ratio. The formation of the latter assembly is determined by kinetic factors (see the Experimental section). Dimer <strong>3</strong> was isolated as the main phase also from solutions in MeCN and THF. The crystals of [Hbpy][Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>(NCS)<sub>4</sub>]·2bpy·2H<sub>2</sub>O (<strong>4</strong>) were obtained from the mother liquor of the reaction mixture in MeCN. The detection of crystals of <strong>4</strong> in the mother liquor indicates that the reaction proceeds through monomer <strong>4</strong> to dimer <strong>3</strong> accompanied by the change in the position of one bpy molecule, which is located in the outer sphere in <strong>4</strong>, whereas it acts as a bridge in <strong>3</strong>. This process is similar to the dimerization of molecular complexes <strong>1</strong> → <strong>2</strong> in going from ethanol to i-PrOH, which results in the change in the coordination mode of the bpy molecule from monodentate in <strong>1</strong> to bridging in <strong>2</strong>. The formation of <strong>3</strong> in solutions in THF occurs in a similar way. It should be noted that insoluble, predominantly amorphous, phases immediately precipitate from the reaction mixture in aprotic solvents (MeCN, THF), complex <strong>3</strong> being the main component. The recrystallization of <strong>3</strong> from acetonitrile afforded crystals of {H<sub>3</sub>(bpy)<sub>4</sub>}[Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)(NCS)<sub>6</sub>] (<strong>5</strong>). An increase in the bpy : Y ratio in acetonitrile led to the formation of {H(bpy)<sub>2</sub>}<sub><em>n</em></sub>[(μ-bpy)Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>(NCS)<sub>4</sub>]<sub><em>n</em></sub> (<strong>6</strong>) as an impurity phase along with <strong>3</strong>.
</p><p>
    Compounds <strong>3–6</strong> contain anionic moieties with four (<strong>3–4</strong> and <strong>6)</strong> or six (<strong>5</strong>) thiocyanate anions in the coordination sphere of yttrium, although the starting thiocyanate contains only three NCS<sup>−</sup> anions. This may be a consequence of the following two processes: the disproportionation of Y(NCS)<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O or the formation of the salt bpyH<sup>+</sup>⋯NCS<sup>−</sup>. The disproportionation (autocomplex formation) of halide complexes into cationic and anionic forms in various solvents is long known.<a href="#cit10"><sup>10</sup></a> We examined this possibility by the recrystallization of the starting sample of Y(NCS)<sub>3</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O in MeCN and THF. According to the X-ray powder diffraction data, new phases formed in none of the cases. To verify the formation of the salt, we prepared {Hbpy}NCS·1.5H<sub>2</sub>O and {H<sub>2</sub>bpy}(NCS)<sub>2</sub><a href="#cit11"><sup>11</sup></a> and identified them by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. However, we failed to detect these salts in the impurity phases that were formed along with <strong>3</strong>. Most likely, the anions of these salts are incorporated into the coordination sphere of yttrium giving rise to thiocyanate anions of yttrium. This is confirmed by a particular time dependence of this process and the dependence on the bpy concentration, as well as by the fact that bpy molecules are present in the solvation sphere of supramolecular assembly <strong>3</strong>. The absence of <strong>3</strong> in alcoholic solutions and the formation of <strong>3</strong> as the main phase in aprotic solvent (MeCN and THF) are undoubtedly associated with the solvation effects. This is supported by the detection of <strong>3</strong> in i-PrOH, which is intermediate as the solvent between lower aliphatic alcohols (methanol, ethanol) and aprotic solvents (MeCN, THF).<a href="#cit7"><sup>7</sup></a> A forced increase in the NCS : Y ratio in the solution by the addition of an aqueous solution of HNCS to the alcoholic solution resulted in the formation of <strong>3</strong> in virtually quantitative yield. According to the X-ray powder diffraction data, this product contains <strong>3</strong> as the main phase (∼80%). The monomer {Hbpy}[Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>(NCS)<sub>4</sub>]·2bpy·2H<sub>2</sub>O (<strong>4)</strong> was found as an impurity, like in the synthesis in MeCN and THF. Besides, the salt {Hbpy}<sub>4</sub>[Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>(NCS)<sub>5</sub>]·(NCS)<sub>2</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O (<strong>7</strong>) was obtained as another impurity. Assembly <strong>3</strong> is readily soluble in ethanol. This is why a polycrystalline product was obtained, after the slow crystallization, in the synthesis with HNCS. An analysis of the positions of the characteristic absorption bands in the IR spectra of <strong>1–3</strong> and their comparison with the data for the starting reagents showed that the most substantial changes are observed for the band <em>ν</em>(NC) of the thiocyanate ligand. The formation of <strong>1–3</strong> is accompanied by the low-frequency shift of this band, on the average, by 30 cm<sup>−1</sup> and it loses the initial structuring. Let us also mention small changes in the position of <em>ν</em>(Y–O); the other shifts are less significant.

    The crystal structure of <strong>4</strong> is composed of anionic complexes, monoprotonated Hbpy cations (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1d</a>), bpy molecules of solvation, and water molecules of crystallization. The N(6)⋯N(8) distance (2.695 Å) is indicative of the formation of a N–H⋯N hydrogen bond. The difference Fourier map shows two peaks of approximately equal height in the vicinity of the N(6) (at a distance of 1.19 Å) and N(8) (at a distance of 1.10 Å) atoms. In the structure refinement, these peaks were interpreted as hydrogen atoms with 0.5 occupancies. Each of the three coordinated water molecules is “continued” as H<sub><em>x</em></sub>bpy (<em>x</em> = 0, 1). The complex anions and water molecules of crystallization are linked together to form layers perpendicular to the <em>c</em> axis, and the layers are linked by H<sub><em>x</em></sub>bpy to form 3D networks.
</p><p>
    The composition of compound <strong>5</strong> can formally be written as {Hbpy}<sub>3</sub>[Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)(NCS)<sub>6</sub>]·bpy. However, the difference Fourier map shows four peaks in the vicinity of the nitrogen atoms of four independent bpy ligands. Hence, we suggest the formula {H<sub>3</sub>(bpy)<sub>4</sub>}[Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)(NCS)<sub>6</sub>]. Two peaks, like those in structure <strong>4</strong>, correspond to one disordered hydrogen atom (N⋯N, 2.655 Å), and we assigned occupancies of 0.33 and 0.67 to these sites based on the heights of the peaks. The coordinates and displacement parameters of all hydrogen atoms (except for disordered hydrogens) in structure <strong>5</strong> were refined independently. For the disordered atoms, only displacement parameters were refined. Seven of the eight nitrogen atoms of Hbpy are involved in hydrogen bonding as hydrogen donors and acceptors. Two disordered hydrogen atoms form an associate {bpy-H⋯bpy}, which is connected to the anionic complex by a O–H⋯N hydrogen bond, and the centrosymmetric moiety ({bpy-H⋯bpy}[Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)(NCS)<sub>6</sub>])<sub>2</sub> in structure <strong>5</strong> is formed through O–H⋯S hydrogen bonds (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1e</a>). The associates {bpy-H⋯bpy} are linked by N–H⋯N and C–H⋯N hydrogen bonds to zigzag 1D chains (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>), which, together with the complex anions, form 2D networks perpendicular to the <em>x</em> axis. Two Hbpy cations, which are not involved in this network, are linked by N–H⋯N hydrogen bonds giving rise to two independent chains parallel to the <em>z</em> axis.

    The crystal structure of <strong>6</strong> is composed of polymer chains parallel to the [10−1] direction (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1f</a>) and Hbpy cations. The quality of the crystal (plates with a thickness of 0.01 mm) allowed us to locate only one of the six hydrogen atoms active in hydrogen bonding. The structural units are linked through N–H⋯N and O–H⋯N(S) hydrogen bonds to form three interpenetrating 3D networks (<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>).

    The crystal structure <strong>7</strong> contains two crystallographically independent structurally identical discrete anionic complexes (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1g</a>), four independent NCS<sup>−</sup> anions, four water molecules of crystallization, and eight H<sub><em>x</em></sub>bpy groups. Since eight protons are required for the charge compensation, it would be suggested that the structure contains eight monoprotonated Hbpy<sup>+</sup> ions. However, the degree of their protonation can be unambiguously determined only for two nitrogen atoms (one atom is an O–H⋯N hydrogen bond acceptor, and another is an N–H⋯S hydrogen bond donor). The other 14 nitrogen atoms are involved in N–H⋯N hydrogen bonding (two nitrogen atoms per hydrogen bond), and the formation of H<sub>2</sub>bpy<sup>2+</sup> + bpy pairs is theoretically possible. The crystal structure of <strong>7</strong> is such that the degree of protonation of particular H<sub><em>x</em></sub>bpy is of no importance for the packing of the structural units. Hence, we will designate these ligands as Hbpy. The complexes, NCS<sup>−</sup> anions, and water molecules of crystallization form 2D networks parallel to the (101) plane, which are linked through {Hbpy⋯Hbpy} dimers to form 3D networks (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7a</a>). The remaining six Hbpy molecules are involved in two crystallographically independent 1D chains {Hbpy}<sub><em>n</em></sub> (both chains are parallel to the [101] direction) with three independent cations held together by stacking interactions per chain (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7b</a>). These doubled chains pass through 3D networks.

    In the seven structurally characterized compounds, the Y : bpy ratio is 1 : 2 (<strong>1–3</strong>), 1 : 3 (<strong>4</strong>, <strong>6</strong>), or 1 : 4 (<strong>5</strong>, <strong>7</strong>). Despite different compositions and arrangement of the structural units, compounds <strong>1–3</strong> have similar crystal structures. Thus, all structures have a primitive rectangular 2D network perpendicular to one of the crystallographic directions (in all cases, to the <em>a</em> axis) (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2a, 3a and 4a</a>), the nodes of which are occupied by Y complexes, and the edges are formed by bpy (monocoordinated, bridging, protonated groups, or molecules of solvation). The network metrics is 14.09 × 15.67, 13.96 × 15.37, and 14.10 × 15.46 Å in <strong>1–3</strong>, respectively (<em>b</em>, <em>c</em> for <strong>1</strong>; <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> × sin(<em>β</em>) for <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong>), The 2D networks are linked by O–H⋯S hydrogen bonds to 3D networks (the distance between the 2D networks corresponds to one-half of the unit cell parameter <em>a</em>). The 3D network contains large cavities occupied by another, identical, interpenetrating network. Since in all three structures under consideration, two independent networks are related by a 2<sub>1</sub> axis, the complexes belonging to one network occupy the centers of the cavities of the second network, and the planar bpy molecules intersect each other (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3c</a> exemplifies the whole unit cell of compound <strong>3</strong>). An increase in the number of bpy groups in the structure leads to a greater ambiguity in the crystal packing, the structure of which is determined mainly by the anionic complex (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1d–g</a>). It should be noted that the aggregation of bpy was found in all compounds <strong>4–7</strong>. Thus, compound <strong>4</strong> contains bpy⋯Hbpy dimers, zigzag 1D chains are present in structure <strong>5</strong> (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>), and linear 1D chains are present in <strong>6</strong> and <strong>7</strong> (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7b</a>). The bond lengths and bond angles in structures <strong>1–7</strong> are typical of such compounds. The CN of yttrium in compounds <strong>1</strong>, <strong>3</strong>, <strong>6</strong>, and <strong>7</strong> is 8; in assemblies <strong>2</strong>, <strong>4</strong>, and <strong>5</strong>, Y<sup>3+</sup> has CN 7.

    The thermal analysis showed that, like the starting complex [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O,<sup>6</sup> complex <strong>1</strong> is stable up to 76 ± 1 °C (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a> and Fig. S2, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: CIF files of the structural data for seven compounds and data collection and structure refinement statistics. CCDC 987443–987449. For ESI and crystallographic data in CIF or other electronic formats see DOI: 10.1039/c4nj00598h">†</a>). At higher temperatures, the thermal decomposition starts. In the temperature range of 76–140 °C, the weight loss is Δ<em>m</em> = 13.5 ± 1.0%. According to the DTA and DSC data, this is a one-step process accompanied by heat release. The gas-phase mass spectrum showed the ions [H<sub>2</sub>O]<sup>+</sup>, [OH]<sup>+</sup>, [C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O]<sup>+</sup>, [C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O]<sup>+</sup>, [C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O]<sup>+</sup>, [CH<sub>3</sub>O]<sup>+</sup>, [CH<sub>2</sub>O]<sup>+</sup>, and [CH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup>. These results provide evidence that the first step corresponds to the removal of the coordinated water and ethanol molecules (the content of H<sub>2</sub>O and EtOH calculated from the empirical formula is 14.8%). The resulting intermediate remains intact without changes in the composition up to 210 °C. At higher temperatures, a rather intricate multistep process takes place (210–440 °C, ∑Δ<em>m</em> = 66.8 ± 1.5%). The gas-phase mass spectrum showed the ions [C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>8</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, [C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>7</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, [C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, [C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, [C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>8</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, [C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>7</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, [C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N]<sup>+</sup>, [C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, [CHN]<sup>+</sup>, [CN]<sup>+</sup>, and [CH<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup>. According to the DSC, DTA, and the analysis of gases evolved during a TGA experiment, at least the two-step decomposition is clearly seen. The first step of this intricate process involves the release of bpy molecules of solvation (<em>t</em><sub>fus</sub> = 114 °C, <em>t</em><sub>boil</sub> = 305 °C), the evaporation of which becomes noticeable at 210 °C. The major portion of bpy is transferred into the gas phase, and the remainder boils at 305 °C (a small endothermic peak). At temperatures above 314 °C, coordinated bpy is apparently detached and completely removed from the intermediate, which is accompanied by the decomposition of NCS<sup>−</sup> (the mass spectrum shows the [CN]<sup>+</sup> ion). The total weight loss in the temperature range under study is ∑Δ<em>m</em> = 81.2%. The study of the thermal behavior of assembly <strong>2</strong> revealed a somewhat different pattern (the boiling point of i-PrOH is 82 °C) (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>). In the temperature range of 50–160 °C, the weight loss is 17 ± 1.0%, two peaks are observed in the DTA/DSC curve, and the main peaks in the mass spectrum are assigned to [H<sub>2</sub>O]<sup>+</sup> and [C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>9</sub>]<sup>+</sup>. In the first step, the coordinated water and i-PrOH molecules are removed (the content of H<sub>2</sub>O and i-PrOH calculated from the empirical formula is 16.5%). In the temperature range of 160–230 °C, the weight loss takes place (Δ<em>m</em> = 33.5 ± 1.0%, which corresponds to the content of bpy molecules of solvation calculated from the empirical formula) accompanied by a considerable endothermic effect. The analysis of gases evolved during a TGA experiment showed ions corresponding to the electron-impact-induced fragmentation of 4,4′-bipyridine. The low, compared to compound <strong>1</strong>, temperature of the onset of the removal of bpy is attributed to the structural features of the assembly. At temperatures above 230 °C, the thermal destruction is virtually identical to the decomposition of compound <strong>1</strong>, which involves the two-step removal of the remaining bpy molecules and the decomposition of NCS<sup>−</sup>. The character of decomposition of anionic dimeric assembly <strong>3</strong> is rather similar to that of compound <strong>1</strong>. The onset of the weight loss (DTA curve) is observed at temperatures above 85 °C; in the range of 85–170 °C, the coordinated water molecules are released step-by-step (DSC and DTA curves) (Δ<em>m</em> = 8.6 ± 1.0%, which corresponds to the 7.8% content of coordinated water molecules calculated from the empirical formula). As in the case of compound <strong>1</strong>, the formation of an intermediate was observed. However, the temperature range, in which this intermediate remains intact without changes in the composition, is more narrow (180–230 °C). A rather intricate multistep process starts at temperatures above 230 °C (230–480 °C, ∑Δ<em>m</em> = 66.8 ± 1.5%). The gas-phase mass spectrum is represented mainly by ions corresponding to the electron-impact-induced fragmentation of 4,4′-bipyridine.

    Earlier, we have measured the excitation and emission spectra of KSCN and the complex [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O.<a href="#cit7"><sup>7</sup></a> The emission bands in the spectra were broad and virtually unstructured. This suggests that the fluorescence of the SCN<sup>−</sup> ions plays a key role in the properties of the complex [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O. We studied the fluorescence of the following complexes in the solid state at room temperature: the molecular assemblies [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>EtOH(bpy)(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·bpy (<strong>1</strong>) and {(μ-bpy)[Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>2</sub>}·3bpy·2(i-PrOH) (<strong>2</strong>), and the assembly [Hbpy]<sub>2</sub>{(μ-bpy)[Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>(NCS)<sub>4</sub>]<sub>2</sub>}·bpy (<strong>3</strong>) composed of the anionic complex and the monoprotonated cation Hbpy. The excitation spectra (<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>) were detected at 450 nm. They consist of two bands with maxima at 234 and 258 nm. But in contrast to the excitation spectrum of [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O (black curve, <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>), the bands in the spectra of <strong>1–3</strong> are distinct. This is evidence of the involvement of the 4,4′-bipyridine ligand in the energy transfer. The bands in the emission spectra measured using excitation at a wavelength of 238 nm are broad, asymmetric, and almost unstructured. Each emission spectrum can be satisfactorily described by two polynomials with maxima at 445 and 465 nm, respectively. It can be seen from <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a> that the maximum of the emission band in the [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O spectrum is at approximately 430 nm. Thus we can conclude that the presence of an additional organic ligand apparently leads to a long-wavelength shift of the emission maximum.

Conclusions
</span>
    </h2>
<p>
    Although the procedure used for the synthesis of assemblies <strong>1–3</strong> is rather simple, the rate of crystallization, the phase homogeneity, and the yield are very sensitive to the nature of the solvent system, which not only determines the composition of molecular assemblies (ethanol, i-PrOH) but also influences the formation of supramolecular aggregates based on anionic complexes of yttrium (i-PrOH, MeCN, THF). In ethanol, assembly <strong>1</strong> forms as a result of the self-assembly, which is not accompanied by the generation of impurities. In aprotic solvents, and partly in i-PrOH, the formation of <strong>3</strong> depends on ditopic 4,4′-bpy, in the presence of which the redistribution of the NCS<sup>−</sup> ligand takes place to give <strong>3–6</strong> containing a large number of anionic ligands in the coordination sphere. This is indicative of the formation of complexes with a higher degree of aquation of the coordination sphere of yttrium and is supported by the yield of <strong>3</strong> (∼50%). We observed a similar situation for ditopic phenanthroline. Thus, the reaction of [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O with 4,7-phen gave [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>7</sub>(NCS)](NCS)<sub>2</sub>·5(4,7-phen)·5(H<sub>2</sub>O).<a href="#cit14"><sup>14</sup></a> The supramolecular aggregation in <strong>1–3</strong> occurs through various hydrogen bonds. The similar packing mode of <strong>1</strong> and <strong>3</strong> is reflected in the similarity of the thermal decomposition of these compounds. The effect of 4,4′-bpy on the fluorescence of yttrium thiocyanate found in the present study holds promise for designing new nitrogen-containing ligands, which can increase the luminescence intensity of thiocyanate complexes.

    The commercial reagents [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O,<a href="#cit6"><sup>6</sup></a> bpy (Aldrich) and the solvents MeOH, EtOH, i-PrOH, THF, MeCN, and Et<sub>2</sub>O were used as is without additional drying or purification. All reactions were carried out in air at room temperature. An aqueous solution of HNCS was prepared by the reaction of a solution of Ba(NCS)<sub>2</sub>·3H<sub>2</sub>O (Vecton, reagent grade) with an equimolar amount of a sulfuric acid standard solution (FIXANAL).
</p><p>
    The elemental analysis was performed according to standard procedures on an EA1108 Carlo Erba CHN analyzer in the Center for Collaborative Research of the Kurnakov Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IGIC RAS). The IR spectra were recorded in the Center for Collaborative Research of IGIC RAS on a Nicolet Nexus FTIR spectrometer in the region of 550–4000 cm<sup>−1</sup>. The X-ray powder diffraction study was performed on a STOE STADI P diffractometer (Cu K<sub>α1</sub> radiation, Ge monochromator) in the Center for Collaborative Research of the Lomonosov Moscow State University.
</p><p>
    The heat capacity of <strong>1</strong> and [Y(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>(NCS)<sub>3</sub>]·H<sub>2</sub>O was measured in the temperature range of 5–298 K in an automatic mode on a BKT-3 low-temperature adiabatic calorimetric setup designed and manufactured by the TERMIS LLC. Weighed samples (0.26396 and 0.5549 g, respectively) were placed in a thin-walled titanium cylindrical container with an inner volume of 1 cm<sup>3</sup>. The container was sealed in a special chamber under a helium atmosphere at a pressure of ≈0.3 bar. The temperature of the calorimeter was measured using a rhodium–iron resistance thermometer. The sensitivity of the temperature-measuring system was 10<sup>−3</sup> K; the sensitivity of the analog-to-digital converter was 0.1 μV. The energy equivalent of the calorimeter was determined by measuring the heat capacity of the empty tube filled with gaseous helium under a pressure of 8.5 kPa. The accuracy of the heat capacity measurements at helium temperatures is ±2%, decreases to ±0.4% as the temperature increases to 40 K, and is ±0.2% in the range of 40−350 K.<a href="#cit15"><sup>15</sup></a>
</p><p>
    The thermal behavior of the compounds was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) on <em>NETZSCH DSC 204 F1</em> and <em>NETZSCH TG 209 F1</em> instruments, respectively.<a href="#cit7"><sup>7</sup></a> Photoluminescence was measured on an LS5 spectrometer (Perkin Elmer) in the region of 200–700 nm at room temperature; the resolution was 0.5 nm and the slit width varied from 4 to 10 nm.
