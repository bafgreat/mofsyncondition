Introduction

    </h2>
<p>
    Metal formate frameworks with the general formula [amineH<sup>+</sup>][M(HCOO)<sub>3</sub>] (M = divalent metal cation) received a lot of attention in recent years due to their rich polymorphism and magnetic, dielectric, negative thermal expansion and negative linear compressibility properties.<a href="#cit1"><sup>1–12</sup></a> Formates containing small cations in the cavities of the framework, such as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and HONH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>, crystallize in the chiral structures<a href="#cit2"><sup>2,13</sup></a> whereas those with larger cations such as dimethylammonium (DMA<sup>+</sup>), imidazolium, formamidinium, <em>etc.</em> as well as [NH<sub>4</sub>][Cd(HCOO)<sub>3</sub>] crystallize in the perovskite structures.<a href="#cit4"><sup>4,5,8,10,11,14</sup></a> Among these compounds, the coexistence of magnetic and ferroelectric order in a single phase was reported for formates containing DMA<sup>+</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> cations as well as [CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>][Co(HCOO)<sub>3</sub>].<a href="#cit2"><sup>2,4,6</sup></a> It is worth noting, however, that multiferroic properties were also suggested for ethylammonium and guanidinium metal formates based on their polar structures and theoretical calculations of ferroelectric polarization.<a href="#cit15"><sup>15,16</sup></a>
</p><p>
    Recently, hydrazinium metal formates of the general formula [NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>][M(HCOO)<sub>3</sub>] (HyM, M = Mg, Mn, Zn, Co) attracted significant attention due to a few reasons. Firstly, these compounds are unique among the family of divalent metal formate frameworks since they can be grown in both chiral and perovskite structures.<a href="#cit17"><sup>17,18</sup></a> Crystallization from methanol solution yielded chiral-type HyMg and HyCo, and perovskite-type HyZn and HyMn.<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a> The presence of both chiral and perovskite structures was attributed to the fact that the size of the hydrazinium cation is intermediate between the ammonium or hydroxylammonium cation, for which chiral structures were reported, and the methylammonium cation, for which the perovskite structure was stable.<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a> Later studies showed another interesting feature, <em>i.e.</em> HyZn could be grown in the chiral architecture when synthesis was performed from a solution containing methanol, water and trimethylamine as templating agents.<a href="#cit18"><sup>18</sup></a> Thermodynamic calculations revealed that for HyZn both chiral and perovskite structures are very close in free energy and that entropy driven effects are responsible for stabilizing the chiral structure.<a href="#cit18"><sup>18</sup></a> Secondly, chiral (perovskite) phases exhibit order–disorder phase transitions from the low-temperature (LT) antiferroelectric <em>P</em>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> phase to the high-temperature (HT) ferroelectric <em>P</em>6<sub>3</sub> phase (the LT ferroelectric <em>Pna</em>2<sub>1</sub> phase to the HT paraelectric <em>Pnma</em> phase).<a href="#cit17"><sup>17,18</sup></a> Since HyCo and HyMn also exhibit magnetic order below 13.9 and 7.9 K, respectively, they are possible multiferroic materials.<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a> Thirdly, studies on HyZn crystallizing in the perovskite structure revealed unusually strong amine–cavity interaction, compared to related perovskites. This behaviour was attributed to the formation of salt bridge-like interactions between the NH<sub>3</sub> group of the hydrazinium cation and the oxygen atoms of the framework.<a href="#cit19"><sup>19</sup></a> Fourthly, it was shown that hydrazinium cations in HyMn can be partially substituted by methylammonium or hydroxylammonium cations.<a href="#cit20"><sup>20</sup></a> These studied showed that the A-site substitution can be used for tuning the ferroelectric, dynamical and mechanical properties of this perovskite framework.<a href="#cit20"><sup>20</sup></a> It is worth adding that A- or B-site substitution in metal formate frameworks is a new emerging way for tuning their properties.<a href="#cit20"><sup>20,21</sup></a>
</p><p>
    The above examples show that hydrazinium metal formates have many interesting properties. In order to better understand rich polymorphism of these compounds, the mechanism of the phase transitions and the structure–property relationship, it is necessary to study related compounds with different divalent cations. It is also important to access the dynamics of the hydrazinium cation using Raman, IR, NMR or EPR methods, and study the effect of different external stimuli, especially temperature and pressure, on the properties of these compounds. In particular, it would be interesting to see if pressure-induced transition can occur between chiral and perovskite phases. We have, therefore, made efforts to synthesize not yet reported HyFe as well as chiral-type HyMn. The obtained compounds have been studied using single crystal X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), magnetization measurements as well as dielectric and IR spectroscopes. Further insight into the dynamics of the hydrazinium cation and the mechanism of the phase transitions is obtained by using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy that is known to be a very sensitive probe for monitoring the changes in the molecular dynamics and the internal structure of the building blocks.<a href="#cit22"><sup>22,23</sup></a> In addition to the temperature-dependent studies, we also report high-pressure Raman scattering studies of both chiral and perovskite HyZn, which provide insights into the pressure-induced changes in amine–formate interactions, the stability of the chiral and perovskite structures and the mechanism of the pressure-induced phase transitions.

    MnCl<sub>2</sub> (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), FeCl<sub>2</sub> (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), methanol (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), hydrazine hydrate (78–82%, Sigma-Aldrich) and formic acid (98%, Fluka) were commercially available and used without further purification. To obtain literature reported perovskite-type single crystals of HyMn and HyZn as well as not yet reported perovskite-type HyFe, 10 mL of methanol solution containing 0.5 mL of hydrazine hydrate and 2 mL of HCOOH was placed at the bottom of a glass tube (9 mm inner diameter). To this solution, 15 mL of methanol solution containing 2 mmol of metal salt was gently added. The tube was sealed and kept undisturbed. Light pink (for Mn), colorless (for Zn) and pale-grey crystals (for Fe) were harvested after 5 days. XRD patterns of these crystals are very similar to those reported in the literature for perovskite-type HyMn and HyZn (space group <em>Pna</em>2<sub>1</sub>).<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a> A good match of their powder XRD patterns with the calculated ones based on the single-crystal data (see Fig. S1 in the ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

    Heat capacity was measured using a Mettler Toledo DSC-1 calorimeter with a high resolution of 0.4 μW. Nitrogen was used as a purging gas and the heating and cooling rate was 5 K min<sup>−1</sup>. The excess heat capacity associated with the phase transitions was evaluated by subtraction from the data the baseline representing variation in the absence of the phase transitions.

    XRD data were collected using an Xcalibur Atlas four-circle diffractometer (Mo Kα radiation, <em>λ</em> = 0.71073 Å). The high temperature was sustained with a hot-air flow attachment (Kuma Diffraction, covering the temperature range of 300–770 K) while an open flow nitrogen cryosystem (Oxford Cryosystem, covering the temperature range of 90–320 K) was used for experiments at low temperatures. The raw area detector (CCD plate) data frames were reduced and corrected for absorption effects using the CrysAlisRED version 1.171.38.34a. Final unit cell parameters were determined by least squares refinement of reflections from the dataset. Direct methods structure solution, difference Fourier calculations, and full-matrix least squares refinement against <em>F</em><sup>2</sup> were performed with SHELXS and SHELXL-2014/7,<a href="#cit24"><sup>24</sup></a> using OLEX 2.52 software. Hydrogen atoms were included in geometric positions (C–H ∼0.96 Å, N–H ∼0.86–0.89 Å) and treated as riding atoms in the LT phases. Due to the disorder of the NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> counterions in the HT phases, the hydrogen atoms were located from the difference Fourier map, but restrained (DFIX) according to the reasonable geometry of hydrazinium ions. The <em>U</em><sub>iso</sub>(<em>H</em>) values were constrained to be 1.2 <em>U</em><sub>eq</sub>(carrier atom). The details of data collection and refinement parameters for perovskite HyFe, chiral HyFe and chiral HyMn along with the crystal description are briefly summarized in Tables S1–S3 (ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

Magnetic measurements

<p>
    Temperature and magnetic-field dependencies of magnetization of a large number of freely oriented single crystals of perovskite HyFe as well as chiral HyFe and HyMn (between about 25 and 75 mg in total) were measured using a commercial Quantum Design SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) magnetometer in the temperature range of 2–30 K and in external magnetic fields up to 50 kOe. The background coming from a weakly diamagnetic sample holder (not shown here) was found in the temperature range studied to be negligible in comparison to the total signal measured. Therefore its subtraction was omitted. No demagnetization corrections were made to the data reported here either.

    The DSC measurements show the presence of one heat anomaly for perovskite HyFe at 347 K upon heating and 344 K upon cooling (Fig. S2, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). A similar anomaly is also observed for perovskite HyMn at 358 K upon heating and 355 K upon cooling (Fig. S3, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

    The associated change in enthalpy Δ<em>H</em> and entropy Δ<em>S</em> was estimated for perovskite HyFe to be ∼2.1 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> and ∼6.3 J mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). From the Boltzmann equation, Δ<em>S</em> = <em>R</em> ln (<em>N</em>), where <em>R</em> is the gas constant and <em>N</em> is the number of sites for the disordered system, and <em>N</em> value can be estimated to be about 2.1. This value is smaller than that reported for perovskite HyMn but it is consistent with X-ray diffraction data showing two discrete states of the hydrazinium cation in the HT phase (see the next paragraph).
</p><p>
    Only one heat anomaly is also observed for chiral HyFe at 336 K upon heating and 334 K upon cooling (Fig. S2, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

This type of behavior suggests that the phase transition in chiral HyFe has a first-order character. <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> also shows that the change in entropy is smaller compared to the perovskite analogue (Δ<em>H</em> and entropy Δ<em>S</em> for chiral HyFe are ∼0.94 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> and ∼3.1 J mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>, respectively).
</p><p>
    DSC data for chiral HyMn differ significantly from those observed for chiral Fe, Co, Zn and Mg analogues. First of all, the heat anomaly is observed at much lower temperature, <em>i.e.</em> at 296 K upon heating and 293 K upon cooling (Fig. S3, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

The associated changes in Δ<em>H</em> and Δ<em>S</em>, ∼0.56 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> and ∼1.9 J mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup> (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>), are even smaller than for chiral HyFe. It is worth noting, however, that the change in entropy at <em>T</em><sub>c</sub> is very sharp, suggesting a strongly first-order character of the phase transition in this compound.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction

<p>
    X-ray diffraction for single crystal of perovskite HyFe shows that the compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic system in the polar space group <em>Pna</em>2<sub>1</sub>. It undergoes a phase transition close to 350 K to the non-polar orthorhombic <em>Pnma</em> space group. In the <em>Pnma</em> structure, the hydrazinium cation is dynamically disordered with its NH<sub>2</sub> group splitting into two positions related by the mirror plane, which is perpendicular to the <em>c</em> axis. The disorder-induced mirror symmetry leads to the formation of a centrosymmetric HT phase. In the LT <em>Pna</em>2<sub>1</sub> phase the hydrazinium cation adopts only one orientation and the mirror plane is lost. The NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> ends of all hydrazinium cations are aslant towards the <em>c</em>-direction. The observed symmetry breaking process can be, therefore, described as <em>mmmFmm</em>2 according to the Aizu notation, and the LT polar phase has polarization along the <em>c</em> axis. The relationship between the unit cell parameters of both LT and HT phases is <em>a</em><sub>HT</sub> ≈ <em>a</em><sub>LT</sub>, <em>b</em><sub>HT</sub> ≈ <em>c</em><sub>LT</sub> and <em>c</em><sub>HT</sub> ≈ <em>b</em><sub>LT</sub>. The compound is isomorphic with previously described in literature perovskite-type HyMn and HyZn.<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a> As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>), the three-dimensional perovskite structure is made up of FeO<sub>6</sub> octahedra, which are connected by formate groups in the <em>anti–anti</em> mode configuration. The NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> molecules (counterions) are located inside the cavities. Each NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> ion is stabilized inside cavities by hydrogen bonds (HBs). In the LT phase we can observe 6 multidirectional N–H⋯O HBs with formate frameworks (Table S4, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). Hydrogen atoms from the NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group are involved in 4 HBs, of which 1 is weak and the other 3 are strong. The NH<sub>2</sub> group donates only 2 medium strength HBs (Table S4, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

</p><p>
    In the HT phase of perovskite HyFe, we can observe a reduction of the HBs between the counterion and the formate framework, which is closely related to a higher symmetry of the structure. Hydrogen atoms from the NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group are involved in 4 HBs, of which 3 are of medium strength and one is strong (Table S4, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). Although the NH<sub>2</sub> group is involved in one HB with the formate oxygen atoms, it is not able to overcome thermally activated motions and, as a result, the NH<sub>2</sub> group is dynamically disordered among two symmetrically equivalent positions related by the mirror plane.

    Selected bond lengths and angles are presented in Table S5 (ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). Comparing the LT and HT phases, a majority of distances and angles for non-hydrogen atoms are very similar. The most affected is the Fe⋯Fe interaction. The closest Fe⋯Fe distances <em>via</em> the bridging HCOO<sup>−</sup> are equal to 5.847 Å and 5.879 Å in the LT and HT phase, respectively. These values are intermediate between Mn⋯Mn (5.908 and 5.939 Å) and Zn⋯Zn (5.791 and 5.819 Å) distances reported for HyMn and HyZn.<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a> This behavior reflects the smaller (larger) size of Fe<sup>2+</sup> compared to Mn<sup>2+</sup> (Zn<sup>2+</sup>). It is interesting to notice that after the phase transition the N–N bond in the hydrazinium ion also changed significantly, from 1.428(5) Å to 1.381(9) Å. Such a decline of the N–N distance is observed due to the librational movement of the counterion in the HT phase. A similar effect was also observed for perovskite-type HyZn and HyMn but the shortening of the N–N bond is significantly larger for HyFe (0.047 Å between 290 and 360 K) compared to HyMn (0.035 Å between 290 and 400 K) and HyZn (0.025 Å between 290 and 375 K).<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a>
</p><p>
    The crystal structures of the HT phases of chiral HyFe and HyMn are isomorphic with previously reported Co- and Mg-analogues.<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a> These structures are hexagonal, with a space group of <em>P</em>6<sub>3</sub>, and the M<sup>2+</sup> ions are octahedrally coordinated by formate groups. The Fe–O (Mn–O) distances are in the range of 2.122(3)–2.123(3) Å at 360 K (2.174(13) Å at 310 K) (see Tables S6 and S7, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). The MO<sub>6</sub> octahedra are connected together in the <em>anti–anti</em> mode configuration. The closest Fe⋯Fe (Mn⋯Mn) distances through the bridging HCOO<sup>−</sup> are equal to 5.963 Å at 360 K (6.042 Å at 310 K) (see Tables S6 and S7, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). The hexagonal channels (along 001 direction) in the anionic framework of [M(HCOO)<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>] are occupied by hydrazinium ions. The protonated amine is stabilized inside cavities by multidirectional N–H⋯O and N–H⋯N HBs (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>). The NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group of HyFe (HyMn) is involved in three (two) N–H⋯O and one (one) N–H⋯N HBs, of which three (two) are weak and one (one) is strong. However the NH<sub>2</sub> group donates three N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds, of which one is strong (Tables S8 and S9, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment. Fig. S1–S15: XRD patterns, DSC traces, view of the structure of perovskite HyFe, the reciprocal space reconstructions for the low-temperature phase of chiral HyFe, the IR and Raman spectra at different temperatures, wavenumber vs. pressure plots of the Raman modes observed in chiral and perovskite HyZn for the compression experiment and Raman spectra recorded during decompression experiments. CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). Strengthening of some N–H⋯N HBs upon cooling should play some role in the onset of the order–disorder phase transition that occurs for chiral HyFe and HyMn at 344 and 293 K, respectively, but this role is probably significantly weaker than the role of the N–H⋯O HBs due to the much smaller number of N–H⋯N HBs compared to the N–H⋯O ones. It is worth noting that the N–H⋯O distances for the NH<sub>2</sub> group are slightly larger for HyMn compared to HyFe, in spite of lower measurement temperature in the former case. This behavior suggests weaker HBs between the NH<sub>2</sub> groups and the anionic framework for HyMn. Similar behavior is observed also for weak N–H⋯O and N–H⋯N HBs formed between the NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> and anionic framework (see Tables S8 and S9, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment. Fig. S1–S15: XRD patterns, DSC traces, view of the structure of perovskite HyFe, the reciprocal space reconstructions for the low-temperature phase of chiral HyFe, the IR and Raman spectra at different temperatures, wavenumber vs. pressure plots of the Raman modes observed in chiral and perovskite HyZn for the compression experiment and Raman spectra recorded during decompression experiments. CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). It is worth noting that the observation of weaker HBs for chiral HyMn is consistent with its lower phase transition temperature. However the strong HB exhibits shortening from 2.92 Å for HyFe to 2.88 Å for HyMn. Furthermore, the corresponding angles increase from 141.7° for HyFe to 150.8° for HyMn (Tables S8 and S9, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>), suggesting the increased strength of this strong HB when going from HyFe to HyMn.

    Regarding LT phases of chiral HyFe and HyMn, due to twinning of the chiral HyFe crystal below phase transition (see Fig. S5, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment. Fig. S1–S15: XRD patterns, DSC traces, view of the structure of perovskite HyFe, the reciprocal space reconstructions for the low-temperature phase of chiral HyFe, the IR and Raman spectra at different temperatures, wavenumber vs. pressure plots of the Raman modes observed in chiral and perovskite HyZn for the compression experiment and Raman spectra recorded during decompression experiments. CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>), it has not been possible to solve its crystal structure to a satisfactory standard. However, our analysis shows that the LT structure is orthorhombic with the lattice parameters <em>a</em> = 7.9904, <em>b</em> = 13.8454, <em>c</em> = 7.574 Å, and <em>V</em> = 838.0 Å<sup>3</sup>. The same metrics was reported for Mg-, Co- and Zn-analogues that are known to transform into the LT phase of <em>P</em>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> symmetry.<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a> Thus our results indicate that the LT phase of HyFe is isostructural with the LT phases of HyMg, HyCo and HyZn. In contrast to HyFe and previously reported HyMg, HyCo and HyZn, HyMn exhibits a different structural change. The LT phase is monoclinic, space group <em>P</em>2<sub>1</sub>, and the asymmetric unit cell is four times bigger compared to the HT one. There are four unique hydrazinium cations that form an extensive HB network with the framework (<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a> and Table S9, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment. Fig. S1–S15: XRD patterns, DSC traces, view of the structure of perovskite HyFe, the reciprocal space reconstructions for the low-temperature phase of chiral HyFe, the IR and Raman spectra at different temperatures, wavenumber vs. pressure plots of the Raman modes observed in chiral and perovskite HyZn for the compression experiment and Raman spectra recorded during decompression experiments. CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). Three hydrazinium cations are ordered whereas one remains disordered in three orientations with occupancy 1/3. The shortest N–H⋯O distances are 2.813, 2.798 and 2.798 Å for the three ordered cations and 2.78 Å for disordered ones (Table S9, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). These distances are shorter than those in the <em>P</em>6<sub>3</sub> phase (at 310 K), indicating increased HB strength. In the LT phase the framework is distorted: each of the four distinct MnO<sub>6</sub> octahedra has six different Mn–O bonds, ranging from 2.139(5) to 2.195(5) Å. The 12 unique HCOO<sup>−</sup> ions also have different C–O bonds ranging from 1.232 to 1.269 Å. The significant changes also disturb the Mn⋯Mn distances through the bridging HCOO<sup>−</sup> ligands, which are in the range of 5.921 to 6.108 Å at 100 K. It is worth noting that the 5.921 Å distance is shorter than that in the HT phase (6.042 Å at 100 K, Table S7, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

<p>
    Temperature dependencies of the magnetization <em>M</em> of the perovskite HyFe and the chiral HyFe measured in a weak applied external magnetic field <em>H</em> = 100 Oe are presented in <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>. As can be noticed, the <em>M</em>(<em>T</em>) curves of both phases look similar to each other. In particular, below 12.5 K they exhibit a clear jump in magnetization measured in the ZFC regime, followed by clear tendency to saturation in the <em>M</em>(<em>T</em>) data collected in the FC regime. This anomaly can be ascribed to a long-range magnetic ordering in both compounds at <em>T</em><sub>m</sub> = 12.5 K. The differences between the ZFC and FC curves and the Brillouin-like shape of <em>M</em>(<em>T</em>) in the FC regime suggest the ferromagnetic character of the observed phase transition. A small anomaly visible in <em>M</em>(<em>T</em>) of chiral HyFe at 3.5 K (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5b</a>) manifests probably some temperature-induced spin reorientation of unknown character, which needs further studies.

    Magnetic hysteresis visible in the field dependencies of the magnetization of both compounds (see the insets to <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>) corroborates the hypothesis on the ferromagnetic ground state of the compounds. It is worth noting however that in each case the hysteresis is visible only below about 25 kOe and is followed in higher magnetic fields by the linear increase of <em>M</em> with increasing <em>H</em>, which suggests that ferromagnetic interactions between magnetic moments of iron are very weak.

    <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a> displays <em>M</em>(<em>T</em>) of the chiral HyMn measured under the same conditions as the phases described above. As seen, the temperature variation of the magnetization of the chiral HyMn does not show any Brillouin-like anomaly at low temperature. Instead, <em>M</em>(<em>T</em>) shows a cusp located at about 9 K with hardly visible bifurcation of the ZFC and FC curves, characteristic of antiferromagnetic phase transitions. The field dependence of the magnetization of HyMn does not show any hysteresis either (see the inset to <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>) – it exhibits only a small change in the slope of <em>M</em>(<em>H</em>) at about 2–3 kOe, which is nearly linear in general.

    The behavior of the perovskite and chiral HyFe is similar to that reported for chiral HyCo and perovskite HyMn, which are magnetically ordered below 13.9 K and 7.9 K, respectively.<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a> A similar Brillouin-like shape of <em>M</em>(<em>T</em>) was also reported for chiral [NH<sub>4</sub>][Fe(HCOO)<sub>3</sub>] (<em>T</em><sub>c</sub> = 9.4 K) or perovskite [NH<sub>2</sub>CHNH<sub>2</sub>][Fe(HCOO)<sub>3</sub>] (<em>T</em><sub>c</sub> = 17 K).<a href="#cit2"><sup>2,25</sup></a> Interestingly, the chiral phase of HyCo exhibited distinct hysteresis in the temperature as well as in the field dependence of the magnetization, while perovskite HyMn showed a much weaker anomaly in <em>M</em>(<em>T</em>) with hardly noticeable hysteresis in <em>M</em>(<em>H</em>).<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a> Moreover, in both systems the <em>M</em>(<em>H</em>) curves were linear in high magnetic fields. All these features led the authors to the conclusion that both phases are examples of weak ferromagnets, <em>i.e.</em> they exhibit spin-canted long-range antiferromagnetic ordering. Detailed analysis allowed them to estimate the canting between two antiferromagnetic lattices (which is responsible for the small ferromagnetic component) as being about 1.1 deg in the chiral HyCo and less than 0.001 deg in the perovskite HyMn.<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a>
</p><p>
    Taking into account similarities between the compounds studied in the present paper to the chiral HyCo and perovskite HyMn reported in <a href="#cit17">ref. 17</a>, one can conclude that perovskite HyFe as well as chiral HyFe are most probably other examples of weak ferromagnets. Moreover, one can suppose that due to hardly visible magnetic hysteresis in <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>, the canting in the chiral phase HyMn is negligible, so in contrast to its perovskite counterpart the chiral phase is almost a pure antiferromagnet. Similar behavior was observed for chiral [NH<sub>4</sub>][Mn(HCOO)<sub>3</sub>], exhibiting antiferromagnetic order at 8.0 K.<a href="#cit2"><sup>2</sup></a> One can underline that the spin-canted antiferromagnetism was observed in many metal–organic frameworks and it is commonly interpreted as resulting from an antisymmetric exchange interaction or single-ion anisotropy,<a href="#cit26"><sup>26,27</sup></a> which are very likely in the compounds studied.
</p><p>
    As mentioned above, the ordering temperatures are almost the same for chiral and perovskite HyFe. Wang <em>et al.</em> showed that the superexchange interaction of neighboring magnetic ions <em>via</em> HCOO ligands plays a leading role in determining their magnetic order.<a href="#cit28"><sup>28</sup></a> The <em>T</em><sub>m</sub> depends in formates almost entirely on the exchange interaction strength of nearest neighbors and these M–OCHO–M superexchange magnetic interactions are related to the angles and distances between magnetic sites.<a href="#cit28"><sup>28</sup></a> Although the low-temperature structure of chiral HyFe was not solved, comparison of the HT phases shows that the closest Fe–Fe distance (the smallest angle of Fe–OCHO–Fe) is 5.879 and 5.962 Å (158.97 and 163.04°) for perovskite and chiral phases, respectively. These values are quite similar for the both phases and this probably explains similar values of the magnetic ordering temperatures for these polymorphs.

The assignments of internal modes corresponding to the internal vibrations of HCOO<sup>−</sup> are straightforward since these vibrations give rise to characteristic bands observed in narrow frequency ranges for different metal formate frameworks.<a href="#cit3"><sup>3,5,14,23,29</sup></a> Internal vibrations of the hydrazinium cations can be observed in a broader frequency range but we assign the bands of this cation on the basis of recently published data for [NH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>][Ln(HCOO)<sub>4</sub>] compounds (Ln = Dy, Er, Y).<a href="#cit30"><sup>30</sup></a> Assignment of the lattice modes is more difficult since these modes may couple each to other. Nevertheless, these modes are observed for the studied compound below 300 cm<sup>−1</sup> and based on our previous studies of formate frameworks the major contribution to the observed Raman bands comes from librational motions of HCOO<sup>−</sup> ions.<a href="#cit3"><sup>3,5,14,23,29</sup></a>
</p><p>
    Raman and IR spectra show that the <em>ν</em><sub>1</sub> (C–H stretching) mode shifts towards higher wavenumbers with decreasing size of the M<sup>2+</sup> cation (Tables S10 and S11, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>), indicating the decrease of the C–H bond length with decreasing size of the unit cell volume. The decrease of the unit cell volume also leads to a significant upshift of the <em>ν</em><sub>3</sub> (O–C–O bending) mode. The stretching modes of the NH<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> groups show a negligible dependence on the type of divalent cation for the perovskite phases, suggesting weak changes in the HB strength. Similar phase transition temperatures for the perovskite HyMn, HyFe and HyZn, <em>i.e.</em>, 355 K (this work), 344 K (this work) and 349 K,<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a> respectively, are consistent with the weak dependence of the HB strength on the type of divalent cation. In the case of chiral phases of HyMn, HyFe and HyZn, many N–H stretching modes shift to lower wavenumbers with decreasing size of the divalent cation. For instance, the 3347, 3283 and 3090 cm<sup>−1</sup> IR bands of HyMn shift to 3339, 3274 and 3071 cm<sup>−1</sup> for the Zn analogue (Table S10, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment. Fig. S1–S15: XRD patterns, DSC traces, view of the structure of perovskite HyFe, the reciprocal space reconstructions for the low-temperature phase of chiral HyFe, the IR and Raman spectra at different temperatures, wavenumber vs. pressure plots of the Raman modes observed in chiral and perovskite HyZn for the compression experiment and Raman spectra recorded during decompression experiments. CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). This behavior indicates strengthening of the HBs in chiral phases with decreasing size of the divalent cations. It is worth noting that the shift of <em>T</em><sub>c</sub> from 293 K for HyMn (this work) to 334 K for HyFe (this work) and 365 K for HyZn<a href="#cit18"><sup>18</sup></a> is consistent with the above conclusion. However, Kieslich <em>et al.</em> suggested based on the X-ray diffraction data that HyMg forms weaker HBs than HyZn in spite of the smaller ionic radius of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (0.72 Å) than Zn<sup>2+</sup> (0.74 Å).<a href="#cit31"><sup>31</sup></a> Unfortunately this conclusion cannot be confirmed by other experimental methods since vibrational data for this compound were not reported. Nevertheless, smaller <em>T</em><sub>c</sub> for HyMg (348 K)<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a> compared to HyZn (365 K)<a href="#cit18"><sup>18</sup></a> is consistent with weaker HBs in the former case. It is also worth adding that the highest <em>T</em><sub>c</sub> of 377 K was reported for chiral HyCo, although Co<sup>2+</sup> is slightly larger (0.745 Å) than Zn<sup>2+</sup>.<a href="#cit31"><sup>31</sup></a> It is not certain if this trend is due to stronger HBs in HyCo since vibrational data for this compound were not reported yet. However, X-ray diffraction data at 110 K suggest stronger HBs for HyCo than HyZn since the N–H⋯O distances for strong HBs are shorter for HyCo (2.813(2)–2.891(2) Å) than HyZn (2.849(3)–2.903(3) Å).<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a>
</p><p>
    The comparison of the spectra also shows that the <em>ν</em><sub>1</sub> modes are observed at significantly higher wavenumbers for the perovskite phases compared to the chiral analogues. This behaviour reflects significantly larger unit cell volumes of the later phases. The IR bands related to the stretching modes of the NH<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> groups are observed at slightly higher wavenumbers for the chiral phases (3347–2961 cm<sup>−1</sup>) than the perovskite ones (3331–2940 cm<sup>−1</sup>) whereas the bending and rocking modes exhibit an opposite behavior (Table S10, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). This behavior indicates that the HB strength decreases upon changing the structure from the perovskite to chiral. It can also be noticed that the <em>ν</em>(NN) modes upshift by about 20 cm<sup>−1</sup> when going from the perovskite to chiral polymorphs, reflecting significant changes in the amine–formate interactions.

The observed behaviour proves that dynamics of the hydrazinium cations plays a major role in the phase transition mechanism and shows that these cations exhibit some amount of motional freedom down to about 220 K. According to the X-ray diffraction data, in the HT phase the HBs are too weak to overcome thermally activated pendulum-like vibrations of the NH<sub>2</sub> group and this group is disordered among two sites related by the mirror plane, <em>i.e.</em> this group occupies two sites with the same probability <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> = 0.5. In the LT phase these vibrations are frozen and these probabilities become <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> = 1 and <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> = 0. Thus the order parameter can be written as <em>η</em> = <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> − <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>. Unfortunately, the vibrational mode related to the order parameter cannot be identified in our Raman spectra since it is probably overlapped by strong bands related to L(HCOO) modes or located below our 50 cm<sup>−1</sup> experimental limit. <a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> also shows splitting of the <em>ν</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>ν</em><sub>2</sub> modes below <em>T</em><sub>c</sub>, indicating that the ordering of hydrazinium cations is associated with the distortion of the framework. This behaviour is consistent with the X-ray diffraction data that revealed one crystallographically independent HCOO<sup>−</sup> cation in the HT phase and three such cations in the LT phase. It is worth adding that higher wavenumber N–H stretching modes, corresponding to the NH<sub>2</sub> groups involved in weaker HBs, exhibit a clear shift towards lower wavenumbers upon cooling (Fig. S11, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>), indicating that the strength of the weak HBs changes slightly. Different behaviour of the perovskite and chiral HyFe can be most likely attributed to significantly weaker amine–formate interactions in the latter polymorph due to the large size of the cavity occupied by the hydrazinium cation. Weaker interactions are further evidenced by the less pronounced shift of the <em>ν</em>(NN) mode upon cooling from 380 to 80 K for chiral HyFe (by 5.2 cm<sup>−1</sup>) compared to perovskite HyFe (13.1 cm<sup>−1</sup>). The ordering is also associated with splitting of bands related to HCOO<sup>−</sup> ions. This splitting is significantly larger compared to the corresponding modes of the perovskite phase, indicating larger distortion of the chiral framework.

    Chiral HyMn shows similar behaviour as chiral HyFe, <em>i.e.</em> significant narrowing of bands, shift of the N–H stretching modes to higher wavenumbers and splitting of the formate modes (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a> and Fig. S11, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

However, Raman spectra of the LT phases of chiral HyMn and HyFe are quite different in the 1380–1340 cm<sup>−1</sup> region (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8b and c</a>). Furthermore, the <em>ν</em>(NN) mode splits into only two components for chiral HyFe and five for HyMn. These features are consistent with our X-ray diffraction data showing different symmetries of the LT phases for the both compounds.

    When pressure increases, the spectra of the perovskite phase exhibit weak changes up to 4.1 GPa. However, significant changes occur in the spectra measured at 5.2 GPa. Firstly, the intensity of the 1387 cm<sup>−1</sup> (1375 cm<sup>−1</sup>) band strongly increases (decreases). Secondly, the 1375 cm<sup>−1</sup> band exhibits downshift by 3.8 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Shifts to lower wavenumbers by 7.8 and 2.3 cm<sup>−1</sup> are also observed for the 809 and 955 cm<sup>−1</sup> bands (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>). Thirdly, a very broad band becomes visible at 324 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Fourthly, a clear change in the slope of wavenumber <em>versus</em> pressure is observed for many Raman modes (see Fig. S12, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment. Fig. S1–S15: XRD patterns, DSC traces, view of the structure of perovskite HyFe, the reciprocal space reconstructions for the low-temperature phase of chiral HyFe, the IR and Raman spectra at different temperatures, wavenumber vs. pressure plots of the Raman modes observed in chiral and perovskite HyZn for the compression experiment and Raman spectra recorded during decompression experiments. CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). These changes indicate that perovskite HyZn undergoes a structural phase transition between 4.1 and 5.2 GPa. It is worth adding here that recent synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies, performed up to 4 GPa, did not reveal any phase transition in this pressure range,<a href="#cit19"><sup>19</sup></a> in agreement with the present Raman data. Significant changes in intensity and abrupt shifts of the 1375, 1387 and 809 cm<sup>−1</sup> bands, corresponding to vibrations of the HCOO<sup>−</sup> ions, prove that perovskite HyZn undergoes a first-order phase transition associated with significant changes in the zinc-formate framework. The weak discontinuous shift of the <em>ν</em>(NN) mode near 955 cm<sup>−1</sup> indicates that the transition also affects weakly the structure of the hydrazinium cation. This band does not split in the high-pressure phase, suggesting the presence of only one crystallographically unique hydrazinium cation in this phase.
</p><p>
    It is worth noting that the largest pressure coefficients <em>α</em> for the ambient pressure phase are observed for the lattice modes (up to 8.63 cm<sup>−1</sup> GPa<sup>−1</sup>, Table S13, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). This result indicates higher compressibility of the ZnO<sub>6</sub> octahedra than formate groups. Recent studies on the mechanical properties of perovskite HyZn indicated that despite the relatively low packing density, this compound has exceptionally large elastic moduli (<em>E</em><sub>001</sub> = 26.5 GPa, <em>E</em><sub>110</sub> = 24.5 GPa), comparable to the stiffest guanidinium manganese formate perovskite-type framework to date.<a href="#cit19"><sup>19</sup></a> Much smaller elastic moduli were reported for perovskite-like analogues with azetidinium (<em>E</em><sub>010</sub> = 12.6 GPa, <em>E</em><sub>101</sub> = 11.7 GPa) and dimethylammonium cations (19 GPa).<a href="#cit32"><sup>32</sup></a> Significantly smaller coefficients <em>α</em> for the <em>ν</em><sub>5</sub>(HCOO<sup>−</sup>), <em>ν</em><sub>2</sub>(HCOO<sup>−</sup>), and <em>ν</em><sub>3</sub>(HCOO<sup>−</sup>) and lattice modes of the ambient pressure phase of perovskite HyZn (2.44, 3.82, 1.84 and up to 8.63 cm<sup>−1</sup> GPa<sup>−1</sup>) compared to the values found for related azetidinium zinc formate<a href="#cit33"><sup>33</sup></a> (6.28, 4.72, 4.29 and up to 12.89 cm<sup>−1</sup> GPa<sup>−1</sup>) and dimethylammonium magnesium formate<a href="#cit34"><sup>34</sup></a> (5.19, 3.49, 4.02 and up to 10.68 cm<sup>−1</sup> GPa<sup>−1</sup>) confirm the unusually high stiffness of the perovskite HyZn. Another interesting observation is that the <em>ν</em>(NN) mode of perovskite HyZn also exhibits a large coefficient <em>α</em> of 3.80 cm<sup>−1</sup> GPa<sup>−1</sup>, indicating the strong effect of pressure on amine–formate interactions. Table S13 (ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment. Fig. S1–S15: XRD patterns, DSC traces, view of the structure of perovskite HyFe, the reciprocal space reconstructions for the low-temperature phase of chiral HyFe, the IR and Raman spectra at different temperatures, wavenumber vs. pressure plots of the Raman modes observed in chiral and perovskite HyZn for the compression experiment and Raman spectra recorded during decompression experiments. CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>) also shows that the <em>α</em> values decrease drastically in the high-pressure phase. This result shows that the high-pressure phase is much stiffer than the ambient pressure one.
</p><p>
    Upon further increasing the pressure, there are no signs of a pressure-induced transition up to 7.8 GPa. However, the spectra become weak and bands exhibit significant broadening. These features suggest that pressure beyond 7 GPa induces some defects or partial amorphization in the sample.
</p><p>
    Raman spectra of the perovskite HyZn during the decompression are presented in Fig. S14 (ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment. Fig. S1–S15: XRD patterns, DSC traces, view of the structure of perovskite HyFe, the reciprocal space reconstructions for the low-temperature phase of chiral HyFe, the IR and Raman spectra at different temperatures, wavenumber vs. pressure plots of the Raman modes observed in chiral and perovskite HyZn for the compression experiment and Raman spectra recorded during decompression experiments. CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). The observed changes in the Raman spectra are similar to those observed upon compression, indicating the reversibility of the phase transition. It is worth noting, however, that the transition pressure upon decompression is much lower than that during compression experiments. The large pressure hysteresis (about 3 GPa) is consistent with the first-order nature of the pressure-induced phase transition.
</p><p>
    <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a> shows that the Raman spectra of chiral HyZn look very similar up to 1.4 GPa, except for pressure-induced shifts of bands. When pressure increases to 2.0 GPa, the spectra exhibit significant changes. Firstly, the bands near 130 and 200 cm<sup>−1</sup> broaden significantly. Broadening is also observed for modes related to HCOO<sup>−</sup> ions as well as the <em>ν</em>(NN) mode. Secondly, the intensity of the 1389 cm<sup>−1</sup> (1373 cm<sup>−1</sup>) band strongly decreases (increases). Furthermore, the intensity of the 1389 cm<sup>−1</sup> band decreases upon further compression and it is no longer resolved at 3.2 GPa. Thirdly, the 1389, 1373 and 969 cm<sup>−1</sup> bands, corresponding to the <em>ν</em><sub>5</sub>, <em>ν</em><sub>2</sub> and <em>ν</em>(NN) modes, exhibit upshift by 3.2, 9.2 and 8.9 cm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Fourthly, a clear change in the slope of wavenumber <em>versus</em> pressure is observed for the <em>ν</em><sub>5</sub> and <em>ν</em><sub>2</sub> modes (see Fig. S13, ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment. Fig. S1–S15: XRD patterns, DSC traces, view of the structure of perovskite HyFe, the reciprocal space reconstructions for the low-temperature phase of chiral HyFe, the IR and Raman spectra at different temperatures, wavenumber vs. pressure plots of the Raman modes observed in chiral and perovskite HyZn for the compression experiment and Raman spectra recorded during decompression experiments. CCDC 1506139–1506145. See DOI: 10.1039/c6cp06648h">†</a>). These changes indicate that chiral HyZn undergoes a structural phase transition between 1.4 and 2.0 GPa. Since the Raman spectrum at 2 GPa is different from the spectrum recorded for perovskite HyZn at the same pressure, it is clear that chiral HyZn does not transform into the perovskite phase under compression. Similar to the perovskite HyZn, the most significant changes at <em>T</em><sub>c</sub> occur for the bands related to vibrations of the HCOO<sup>−</sup> ions. Thus the phase transition in this polymorph is also associated with the change in the zinc-formate framework. Broadening of bands and the decrease in the number of bands suggest that the phase transition leads to a disordered phase with increased symmetry. Furthermore, the structure of the hydrazinium cation is also significantly affected, as evidenced by the large shift of the <em>ν</em>(NN) mode.
</p><p>
    Regarding the coefficients <em>α</em>, they are significantly larger for the ambient pressure phase of chiral HyZn than perovskite HyZn. This result indicates much smaller stiffness of the former polymorph, in agreement with X-ray diffraction studies that show expansion of the framework upon perovskite to chiral transformation. The decrease of these coefficients in the high-pressure phase of chiral HyZn points to significant contraction of the unit cell at the transition pressure. However, this change is much less pronounced compared to the perovskite polymorph, indicating that the high-pressure phase of chiral HyZn is still relatively soft.
</p><p>
    When pressure increases beyond 2.0 GPa, the bands become weaker and broader and they are hardly observed already at 7.0 GPa (<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>). This behavior suggests that chiral HyZn starts to amorphize at high pressures.
</p><p>
    Raman spectra of chiral HyZn during the decompression are presented in Fig. S15 (ESI<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Tables S1–S14: crystal data and selected geometrical parameters for the studied compound at different temperatures, IR wavenumbers at room temperature together with the proposed assignments, Raman wavenumbers at 80 and 380 K, wavenumber intercepts at zero pressure (ω0) and pressure coefficients (α = dω/dP) for the two phases of chiral HyZn and perovskite HyZn observed in the high pressure experiment.

Comments on polymorphism of the studied compounds

    </h3>
<p>
    Kieslich <em>et al.</em> showed that the presence of chiral phases for HyM compounds (M = Mn, Zn, Co, Mg) cannot be explained based on the concept of the tolerance factor (TF) since the calculated values of TF for these compounds are in the range of 0.814–0.845,<a href="#cit18"><sup>18</sup></a><em>i.e.</em> within the 0.81–1.0 range for which the perovskite architecture is stable.<a href="#cit35"><sup>35</sup></a> The authors concluded on the basis of DFT calculations that the chiral phases become stable at higher temperatures due to the higher contribution of the vibrational entropy of the less dense chiral phase compared to the perovskite polymorph.<a href="#cit18"><sup>18</sup></a> This additional contribution to the free energy results in crossover at about 330 K for HyZn, indicating that at room temperature the perovskite phase is still more stable than the chiral one.<a href="#cit18"><sup>18</sup></a> It has also been argued that weaker HBs in HyMg lead to lowering of the crossover temperature to 300 K and as a result this compound crystallizes at room temperature in the chiral structure.<a href="#cit18"><sup>18</sup></a> Our present IR and X-ray diffraction results show that for chiral phases the HB strength decreases when Zn<sup>2+</sup> is replaced by larger Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>. One could expect, therefore, that the crossover temperature due to vibrational entropy contribution for HyFe and HyMn should be lower than that for HyZn. Despite this, our results show that for HyFe and HyMn the most stable phases are still perovskite ones (see below). Thus the vibrational entropy contribution for these compounds seems to be still too small to shift the crossover temperature to room temperature or below.
</p><p>
    Kieslich <em>et al.</em> also suggested that small changes in reaction kinetics might facilitate the formation of different structures.<a href="#cit18"><sup>18</sup></a> Our data support this conclusion since we show that chiral polymorphs grow easily from 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone or the mixture of this solvent with methanol. 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone affords a much higher viscosity than methanol; therefore, the ion diffusion rate was slowed down. It has also been suggested that the transformation of the thermodynamically unstable chiral polymorph of HyZn to the stable perovskite one in air is related to surface water that makes recrystallization of the sample.<a href="#cit18"><sup>18</sup></a> Our results support this conclusion since HyZn chiral crystals have not transformed into the perovskite phase for at least half a year when kept in a closed container. Furthermore, when part of the chiral HyFe was kept in a closed glass container and another part was left in air, the former one was stable for many days whereas the latter one transformed into the perovskite phase after just 2 days. Another interesting observation is that small HyFe crystallites transformed much faster into the perovskite phase than the large ones. These observations strongly suggest that water vapor plays a major role in the observed transformation. It is important to add here that the chiral phase of HyMn was the least stable one and it transformed to the perovskite one in less than a week even when it was kept in a closed container. We suppose that this behavior can be attributed to the small size of the obtained crystals and the higher hygroscopicity of this compound due to the large size of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and thus the larger size of the channels occupied by the hydrazinium cations.
</p><p>
    High-pressure data show that the less dense chiral polymorph does not transform into the denser perovskite one upon compression, despite the small difference in the free energy of the both polymorphs. This behavior is most likely related to kinetic reasons, <em>i.e.</em> transformation from the chiral to perovskite phase may be very slow at room temperature since it would require significant reorganization of the crystal structure. It is worth adding, however, that since the high-pressure data give evidence for much larger stiffness of the perovskite polymorph compared to the chiral one, we suppose that the contribution of the vibrational entropy to the free energy will decrease faster for the chiral polymorph, <em>i.e.</em> the contribution of vibrational entropy to the free energy should become less important upon compression.

Conclusions
</span>
    </h2>
<p>
    We show that perovskite HyFe crystals can be grown from a methanol solution. We also show that chiral phases of HyMn, HyFe and HyZn can be obtained using a much simpler method than reported previously, <em>i.e.</em> through a slow diffusion method from 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone or its mixture with methanol.

    X-ray diffraction data show that perovskite (chiral) phases of HyFe are isostructural to perovskite (chiral) phases of HyZn and HyMn (HyZn, HyMg and HyCo). Furthermore, these compounds undergo structural phase transitions above room temperature that lead to the same change in symmetry as reported for other analogues, <em>i.e.</em> from the <em>Pnma</em> to <em>Pna</em>2<sub>1</sub> structure for perovskites and <em>P</em>6<sub>3</sub> to <em>P</em>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> for chiral phases. In contrast to this behavior, chiral HyMn undergoes transition from <em>P</em>6<sub>3</sub> to <em>P</em>2<sub>1</sub> symmetry. IR and Raman data provide evidence for strengthening of HB strength with decreasing size of the metal ions for chiral phases. They also show evidence for significantly weaker HBs of chiral phases compared to perovskite analogues. X-ray diffraction and Raman studies also show that the phase transitions are governed by dynamics of the hydrazinium ions. Both perovskite HyFe and chiral HyMn exhibit magnetic order at low temperatures, <em>i.e.</em> these compounds are possible new members of metal formate frameworks exhibiting coexistence of magnetic and electric orders in a single phase. It is worth adding that the magnetic properties of chiral HyMn are significantly different from those reported for the perovskite analogue.
</p><p>
    In addition to the temperature-dependent studies, we also performed high-pressure Raman studies of both chiral and perovskite HyZn. These studies show that the chiral phase is less stiff compared to the perovskite one. They also show that pressure does not induce the transition of the chiral phase into the perovskite one. However, both polymorphs undergo pressure-induced phase transitions between 1.4 and 2.0 GPa (4.1 and 5.2 GPa) for chiral HyZn (perovskite HyZn). These transitions are related to significant changes in the zinc-formate framework, while the hydrazinium ions are weakly affected. The obtained data also suggest that the high-pressure phase of chiral HyZn is disordered. Furthermore, the high-pressure phase of perovskite HyZn is much stiffer than its ambient pressure one but the high-pressure phase of chiral HyZn is still relatively soft.
