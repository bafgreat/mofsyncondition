    Metal coordination polymers are important materials both in chemistry and materials science branches, through their specific structures, properties, and reactivities that are not found in mononuclear compounds.<a href="#cit1"><sup>1–10</sup></a> Nanometer-sized particles of any type of compounds are interesting, especially nano metal coordination polymers, because of the fascinating way of exploring them. Their unique properties are controlled by the large number of surface molecules, which experience an entirely different environment than those in a bulk crystal. Controlling the growth of materials at the submicrometer scale is of central importance in the emerging field of nanotechnology.<a href="#cit11"><sup>11</sup></a> Although considerable effort has been dedicated to the controlled synthesis of nanoscale particles of metals, oxides, sulfides, and ceramic materials, little attention has been focused to date on nanoparticles of supramolecular compounds such as coordination polymers. Several different synthetic approaches have been offered for the preparation of coordination polymers. Some of them are (1) slow diffusion of the reactants into a polymeric matrix, (2) diffusion from the gas phase, (3) evaporation of the solvent at ambient or reduced temperatures, (4) precipitation or recrystallisation from a mixture of solvents, (5) temperature controlled cooling and (6) hydrothermal synthesis. In this paper we describe a simple synthetic sonochemical preparation of nano-structure of a new coordination polymer. This article focuses on the simple synthetic preparation of nano-structure of a new Pb(II) two-dimensional mixed-ligand lead(II) coordination polymer, [Pb(3-pyc)(N<sub>3</sub>)(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sub><em>n</em></sub> (<strong>1</strong>), 3-Hpyc = 3-pyridinecarboxylic acid}, and on its conversion into nano-structured lead oxide by calcination at moderately elevated temperature.

    Quite an elegant approach used in the synthesis of nanomaterials is sonochemistry. In this method molecules are promoted to form a nano-sized hedge ball by the application of powerful ultrasound radiation (20 KHz–10 MHz), mostly by the instantaneous formation of a plethora of crystallization nuclei. The reaction of 3-pyridinecarboxylic acid (3-Hpyc) with a mixture of lead(II) acetate and sodium azide led to the formation of the new lead(II) 2D coordination polymer [Pb(3-pyc)(N<sub>3</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>O]<sub><em>n</em></sub> (<strong>1</strong>). Nano-hedge balls of <strong>1</strong> were obtained by ultrasonic irradiation in a water solution and single crystalline material was obtained using a heat gradient applied to a solution of the reagents (the “branched tube method”). The elemental analysis and IR spectra of the nanostructure and of the single crystalline material are indistinguishable (Fig. S1).<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: IR spectra; structural data; TGA and DTA diagrams; XRD patterns; SEM photographs; crystal data, structure refinement, bond lengths and angles for 1.

The absorption bands with a variable intensity in the frequency range 1339–1598 cm<sup>−1</sup> correspond to vibrations of the pyridine rings. The broad band near 3300 cm<sup>−1</sup> shows existence of water molecule. The presence of a strange band near 2020 cm<sup>−1</sup> is due to the azide ligand (Fig. S1).<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: IR spectra; structural data; TGA and DTA diagrams; XRD patterns; SEM photographs; crystal data, structure refinement, bond lengths and angles for 1.

    <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> shows the simulated XRD pattern from single crystal X-ray data (see below) of compound <strong>1</strong> in comparison with the XRD pattern of a typical sample of <strong>1</strong> prepared by the sonochemical process (and <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). Acceptable matches, with slight differences in 2<em>θ</em>, were observed between the simulated and experimental powder X-ray diffraction patterns (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1b and c</a>). This indicates that the compound obtained by a sonochemical process has a single crystalline phase, almost identical to that obtained by the branched tube method.

    The significant broadening of the peaks indicates that the particles are of nanometer dimensions. Estimated by the Sherrer formula, <em>D</em> = 0.891<em>λ</em>/<em>β</em>cos<em>θ</em>, where <em>D</em> is the average grain size, <em>λ</em> the X-ray wavelength (0.15405 nm), and <em>θ</em> and <em>β</em> the diffraction angle and full-width at half maximum of an observed peak, respectively, the average size of the particles is 60 nm, which is in agreement with that observed by scanning electron microscopy, as shown in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>. The morphology of compound <strong>1</strong> prepared by the sonochemical method (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>) is very interesting. It is composed of rods with sizes of about 60 nm, with all rods arranged so that they form a hedge ball network (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>). The mechanism of formation of this network structure needs to be further investigated, however it may be a result of the crystal structure of the compound which is a two-dimensional layered network (see below), <em>i.e.</em> the packing of the structure on a molecular level might have influenced the morphology of the nano-structure of the compound.

    To examine the thermal stability of the nanosized particles and the single crystals of compound <strong>1</strong> sample, thermal gravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analyses (DTA) were carried out between 20 and 600 °C under nitrogen flow (Fig. S3).<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: IR spectra; structural data; TGA and DTA diagrams; XRD patterns; SEM photographs; crystal data, structure refinement, bond lengths and angles for 1.

Between this temperature and 424 °C removal of 3-pyc<sup>−</sup> ligand occurs with a mass loss of 35.66% (calcd 42.63%). Mass loss calculations show that the final decomposition product is PbO (Fig. S3).<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: IR spectra; structural data; TGA and DTA diagrams; XRD patterns; SEM photographs; crystal data, structure refinement, bond lengths and angles for 1.

Detectable decomposition of the nano-structure of <strong>1</strong> thus starts at about 20 °C earlier than that of its bulk counterparts, probably due to the much higher surface to volume ratio of the nano-sized rods as more heat is needed to annihilate the lattices of the single crystals. The DTA curves display one distinct endothermic effect at 105 °C for the single crystals of compound <strong>1</strong> (Fig. S3)<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: IR spectra; structural data; TGA and DTA diagrams; XRD patterns; SEM photographs; crystal data, structure refinement, bond lengths and angles for 1.

The difference between the four maximum intensities in the DTA curves also indicates, in agreement with the TGA results, the lower stability of the nano-structure when compared to its single crystal counterpart.

    The thermal decomposition of the nano-structure of <strong>1</strong> in air produced PbOnanoparticles, as established by their powder XRD patterns (Fig. S4).<a href="#fn1" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: IR spectra; structural data; TGA and DTA diagrams; XRD patterns; SEM photographs; crystal data, structure refinement, bond lengths and angles for 1.

This nano-structure shows a high degree of crystallinity with sharp and well defined peaks in the XRD pattern. Orthorhombic PbOnanoparticles are the only crystalline phases present and all diffraction peaks were indexed with the PbO lattices with the parameters <em>a</em> = 5.8931(4) Å, <em>b</em> = 5.4904(4) Å, <em>c</em> = 4.7528(4) Å, <em>Z</em> = 4 in <em>Pbcm</em> for PbO (JCPDS card file No. 77-1971). No characteristic peaks of impurities are detected in the XRD pattern. The broadening of the peaks indicated that the particles are of nanometer scale.

    In summary, a new Pb(II) coordination polymer, compound <strong>1</strong>, has been synthesized using a thermal gradient approach and by sonochemical irradiation. Compound <strong>1</strong> was structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal structure of compound <strong>1</strong> consists of a two-dimensional polymer and shows that the coordination number in the Pb<sup>II</sup> ions is seven. Reduction of the particle size of the coordination polymer of <strong>1</strong> to a few dozen nanometers results in lower thermal stability when compared to the single crystal samples. Calcination under air produces nano-sized particles of PbO. This study demonstrates that the coordination polymers may be suitable precursors for the preparation of nanoscale materials and dependent on their packing they may produce different and interesting morphologies. It is interesting to note that this precursor is one of the few samples prepared by sonication as an alternative synthetic procedure to form nano-sized particles of a coordination polymer. This method of preparation may have some advantages such as: it takes place with shorter reaction times, produces better yields and it also likely to produce nano-sized particles of the coordination polymer. From this perspective, further systematic studies of other coordination polymers with different metal ions are ongoing in our laboratory, which may offer new insights into metal–organic coordination polymers and nanochemistry.
