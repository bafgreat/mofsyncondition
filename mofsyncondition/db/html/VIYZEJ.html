Introduction
</span>
    </h2>
<p>
    Great effort has been expended on crystal engineering of metal–organic networks, not only for the pragmatic perspective to obtain new functional materials,<a href="#cit1"><sup>1</sup></a> but also for the fundamental interest to reveal the intriguing structural diversity and the physical laws underlying the assembling processes.<a href="#cit2"><sup>2</sup></a> The assembly of polymeric networks directed by metal–ligand coordination bonding interactions has attained a relatively mature level, and by the judicious selection of metal ions and organic ligands with definite coordination preferences, a plethora of coordination networks with specific topologies have been successfully constructed.<a href="#cit3"><sup>3</sup></a> However, the control of the packing of the low-dimensional coordination motifs, which is dependent upon inter-motif weak non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking interactions, is still a great challenge fraught with difficulties.<a href="#cit4"><sup>4</sup></a> In favorable cases, the information of non-covalent interactions could be stored in the low-dimensional motifs, and recognized and expressed in the packing of the motifs in the final architectures.<a href="#cit5"><sup>5</sup></a> In this regard, it is very important to investigate the different packing patterns of low-dimensional motifs bearing different information, which should aid to the rational construction of new functional materials in a more controlled manner.
</p><p>
    We are interested in the packing of zigzag chains bearing the information for interchain recognition. In practice, the packing usually occurs with all the chains being parallel, with or without relative rotation or slipping along the chain axes.<a href="#cit6"><sup>6–11</sup></a> Less common is that zigzag chains with different orientations are alternately arranged in parallel layers, with the chains in a single layer being parallel.<a href="#cit10"><sup>10–13</sup></a> In principle, the packing can also occur through supramolecular entanglement, <em>i.e.</em>, zigzag chains with different orientations are interwoven into high-dimensional entangled networks. However, this is still an extremely rare occurrence. Two examples of 2D entanglement of zigzag chains have been reported, where the chains in two different directions are interwoven into unusual cloth-like warp-and-woof networks.<a href="#cit14"><sup>14</sup></a> In a recent preliminary communication we reported the first example of 3D entanglement, which is achieved by the zigzag chains built of Zn<sup>II</sup>, <em>trans</em>-stilbene-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (H<sub>2</sub>STDC) and 1,10-phenathroline (phen).<a href="#cit15"><sup>15</sup></a>
</p><p>
    The use of rigid and linear aromatic dicarboxylates as bridging ligands between divalent transition metal ions, in combination with the use of aromatic bidentate reagents as terminal chelating ligands, represents a rational strategy for designing zigzag chains, as exemplified by the 1D coordination polymers obtained from 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) and phen or 2,2′-bipyridine (bipy).<a href="#cit7"><sup>7–10</sup></a> These 1D motifs are equipped with different potential recognition sites for inter-motif interactions that may direct the packing in space, such as the carboxylate groups for hydrogen bonding, and the aromatic rings from the bridging and terminal ligands for π–π stacking. Consequently, it is very desirable to systematically investigate how the chain structure and the 3D packing are influenced by varying the bridging or terminal ligand. With this in mind, we present here a series of Zn<sup>II</sup>–STDC coordination polymers with different terminal ligands: pyridine (py), bipy, phen and 2,2′-biquinoline (biql). Their formula are [Zn(STDC)(py)<sub>2</sub>]·py (<strong>1</strong>), [Zn(STDC)(bipy)(H<sub>2</sub>O)]·0.5py·H<sub>2</sub>O (<strong>2</strong>), [Zn(STDC)(biql)] (<strong>3</strong>), [Zn(STDC)(phen)]·solv (solv = DMSO, <strong>4a</strong>; DMF, <strong>4b</strong>). Compound <strong>4a</strong> has been preliminarily communicated.<a href="#cit15"><sup>15</sup></a>
</p><p>
    With the metal ion and bridging ligand unaltered but the terminal ligands varied systematically, these 1D zigzag polymers constitute a relatively complete series to allow the systematic investigation on the effects of terminal ligands. As to the influences of bridging ligands, the comparative inspection into these 1D structures and the previously reported BDC analogues should be informative. In addition, except for <strong>3</strong>, all the compounds reported here exhibit open channels, and compounds <strong>2</strong> and <strong>4</strong> exhibit reversible guest inclusion properties.

    Diffraction intensity data for <strong>1</strong> were collected on a Bruker Apex II CCD area detector equipped with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (<em>λ</em> = 0.71073 Å). Diffraction intensity data for <strong>2</strong>–<strong>4</strong> were collected at room temperature on a Nonius KappaCCD area detector equipped with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation.<a href="#cit15"><sup>15</sup></a> An empirical absorption correction was applied.<a href="#cit17"><sup>17</sup></a> All the structures were solved by the direct method and refined by the full-matrix least-squares method on <em>F</em><sup>2</sup> with anisotropic displacement parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms.<a href="#cit18"><sup>18</sup></a> The stilbene moiety in the structure of <strong>1</strong> exhibits disorder over two sites, and the occupancies were refined to be 0.54 and 0.46. All the hydrogen atoms in the frameworks were placed in calculated positions and refined using the riding model. The hydrogen atoms of the disordered water molecules in <strong>2</strong> and the disordered DMSO molecules in <strong>4a</strong><a href="#cit15"><sup>15</sup></a> were not located. The existence of guest molecules in <strong>4b</strong> was indicated by the large residue peaks (max. 1.35 e Å<sup>−3</sup>) in the channels, but they could not be crystallographically identified due to the severe disorder problem. According to analytic data, TGA analysis, IR spectra and relevant guest inclusion/exchange experiments, the guest molecules were proposed to be DMF. A summary of the crystallographic data and refinement details for <strong>1</strong>–<strong>4</strong> are given in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>.

Descriptions of crystal structures

<p>
    X-Ray analyses revealed that the structures of the compounds are all consist of infinite 1D zigzag polymeric chains, in which the Zn<sup>II</sup> corners are decorated by the pyridine-derived terminal ligands and linked by the linear STDC ligands, which have, in all cases, inversion centers at the midpoints of the central C<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]">C bonds. However, these structures significantly differ in metal coordination environments, the coordination modes of the bridging ligand, the geometry (such as the corner angles) of the chains, and especially the packing of the chains, as will be discussed below.

</span>
    </h4>
<p>
    The zinc(<span class="small-caps">ii</span>) ion in compound <strong>1</strong> lies on a crystallographic <em>C</em><sub>2</sub> axis and is six-coordinated by two equivalent pyridines and two equivalent chelate carboxylato groups from different STDC ligands. The carboxylato group adopts a highly asymmetric bidentate mode, as evidenced by the large difference in Zn–O distances (1.94 <em>vs.</em> 2.76 Å, <a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). The coordination geometry around Zn<sup>II</sup> is highly distorted from octahedral and can be described as a bicapped tetrahedron: the shortly bonded oxygens and the pyridinenitrogens define a tetrahedron, while the weakly bonded oxygens (O2 and O2A) are hanged over the two faces sharing the two nitrogens (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>). The STDC ligand is centrosymmetric and serves as a bis(bidentate) bridge between the Zn<sup>II</sup> ions, with Zn⋯Zn = 17.53 Å. The combination of the coordination geometry of the metal ion and the rigid linearity of the ligand dictates a zigzag chain (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>), with a turning angle (defined by three adjacent metal ions) of 126.8° and a repeated period of 31.35 Å.

    All the chains are aligned in parallel to the [201] direction, with the terminal pyridineligands stretching out in four directions, and they are arranged in space in such a complementary way that each chain interacts with four identical chains <em>via</em> weak C–H⋯O hydrogen bonds: each pyridine molecule from one chain uses the C11–H11 group to interact with the weakly coordinated carboxylato oxygen atom from adjacent chains (C11⋯O2A = 3.205(8) Å; H11⋯O2A = 2.45 Å; C11–H11⋯O2A = 137.8°; with A = –<em>x</em>, 2 − <em>y</em>, <em>z</em> + 0.5). The hydrogen bonds occur in pairs and separate the metal ions from different chains by 8.92 Å. Taking into account the hydrogen bonding interactions, the resulting structure can be described as a 3D diamond network, in which the four connections between the tetrahedral nodes (Zn) fall into two types: the long coordination connections constituted by the STDC ligands and the short connections completed by double hydrogen bonding between the pyridyl and carboxylato groups (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2(a)</a>, and <a href="#fig2">(b)</a>). It is well-known that diamond frameworks have a strong propensity to interpenetrate to fill the void space within a single net.<a href="#cit19"><sup>19</sup></a> In the present case, four identical diamond nets interpenetrate in the normal mode, with neighboring nets being related by a translation of 1/4<em>b</em> along the crystallographic <em>b</em> direction (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2(c)</a>). Despite the four-fold interpenetration, there are still 1D channels left along <em>c</em> direction, and PLATON calculations<a href="#cit20"><sup>20</sup></a> indicated that the channels, with dimensions of <em>ca.</em> 4 × 4 Å, comprise 26.0% of the crystal volume (369 Å<sup>3</sup> per unit cell). Enclosed in the channels are free pyridine guest molecules.

    From the viewpoint of chain packing, the zigzag chains in <strong>1</strong> are arranged in layers along the (102) planes. As shown in <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>, the chains in the same layer are aligned in a corner-in-corner fashion, and the chains in adjacent layers are parallel and slipped with respect to each other by half of the repeat period. Thus, the layers are packed in the ABAB sequence with an interlayer distance of about 7.5 Å. Obviously, such a packing mode of the chains is stabilized by the above-mentioned hydrogen bonding interactions, which link the chains from different layers into the diamond net. Every four consecutive chains in the same layer belong respectively to the four interpenetrating nets.

    </h4>
<p>
    The Zn<sup>II</sup> ion in <strong>2</strong> exhibits a distorted octahedral coordination geometry, completed by a chelate bipy molecule, a bidentate carboxylato group, a monodentate carboxylato group, and a water molecule (<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>). The zigzag chain contains two independent sets of centrosymmetric STDC bridges in different coordination modes, bis(bidentate) and bis(monodentate), which alternately separate the Zn<sup>II</sup> ions by 17.43 and 17.58 Å, respectively. As evidenced by the Zn–O distances (<a href="#tab3">Table 3</a>), the bidentate carboxylato group is much less asymmetric than that in <strong>1</strong>. The corner angle and the repeat period of the resulting zigzag chain are 135.0° and 32.36 Å, respectively, indicating that the chain is less bent than that in <strong>1</strong>. The relatively larger corner angle in <strong>2</strong> may be mainly due to the incorporation of the water molecule (O5) into the position <em>trans</em> to a bipy nitrogen atom, thus, the monodentate carboxylato group is disposed at the position <em>trans</em> to an oxygen atom (O3) from the chelate carboxylato group to reduce interligand steric hindrance.

    All the chains in <strong>2</strong> are arranged in parallel to the [1−22] direction. There are two types of interchain interactions. As shown in <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5(a)</a>, the chains, with the terminal bipyligands bristling outwards from the corners of the chains, are arranged in a corner-to-corner fashion to facilitate relatively strong face-to-face π–π stacking interactions between bipy groups from different chains. The two interacting bipy groups are related by inversion centers, and the interplanar and centroid–centroid distances are 3.55 and 3.74 Å, respectively. The interactions arrange the zigzag chains into an undulated 2D layer along the (−212) plane, and the layer may be regarded as a (6,3) net with two different types of connections (the STDC ligand and the π–π stacked bipy pair) between nodes (the metal ions). The Zn⋯Zn distance separated by the π–π stacked bipy pair is 7.58 Å, which is much shorter than those by the STDC ligands.

    The other type of interchain interactions is the hydrogen bonding between the coordinated water molecule (O5) from one chain and a coordinated carboxylato oxygen atom (O3) from another chain, with O⋯O = 2.79 Å and O–H⋯O = 171.3°. As shown in <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5(b)</a>, the chains are also arranged in a corner-to-corner fashion in the (210) plane to facilitate the formation of self-complementary double hydrogen-bonded motifs between the corners of neighboring chains, The resulting 2D layer in the (210) plane can also be regarded as a (6,3) network, taking the double hydrogen-bonded motif as the connection besides the STDC ligand. The Zn⋯Zn distance separated by the double hydrogen-bonded motif is 5.81 Å, which is much shorter than those by the STDC ligands. The coordinated water molecule also forms a strong intrachain hydrogen bond with the uncoordinated oxygen atom (O2) from the monodentate carboxylato group (O5⋯O2 = 2.57 Å and O–H⋯O = 155.5°), which should help to stabilize the zigzag chain.
</p><p>
    As a whole, the zigzag chains in <strong>2</strong> are assembled into a 3D supramolecular architecture <em>via</em> the interchain π–π stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5(c)</a>). The two different interactions alternate along the <em>a</em> direction and gather the corners of the chains into supramolecular columns (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5(d)</a>). The 3D assembly closely resembles a pillared-layer network, where the hydrogen-bonded layers in the (210) planes are interlinked by the π–π stacked bipy pairs (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5(e)</a>). Topologically, the architecture can also be regarded as a 3D diamond net, generated by the two sets of undulated (6,3) layers along the (−212) and (210) planes sharing the zigzag coordination chains (<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6(a)</a>). Different from those in <strong>1</strong>, the four connections around each tetrahedral node (Zn) in <strong>2</strong> include two long coordination connections through the two independent STDC ligands, a much shorter connection set up by the π–π stacked bipy pair, and an even shorter connection completed by the double hydrogen bonding. To occupy the very large ‘void’ space in a single net, two such nets interpenetrate each other, with the metal coordination spheres of one net located at the channel centers of the other net (<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6(b)</a>). An alternative description of the overall packing pattern is that the parallel chains are packed in the layers defined by the (011) planes in a staggered side-by-side fashion. The layers are stacked in parallel <em>via</em> the π–π stacking and hydrogen bonding.

    Despite the interpenetration, there are still open channels of about 9 × 12 Å along the <em>a</em> direction, which are filled by guest pyridine and water molecules. PLATON calculations<a href="#cit20"><sup>20</sup></a> show that the guest-accessible volume comprises 29.8% of the crystal volume (439 Å<sup>3</sup> per unit cell).

<p>
    The zinc<sup>II</sup> ion in <strong>3</strong> also lies in a six-coordinative [N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>] surrounding, completed by a chelate biql ligand, two independent chelate carboxylato groups. One of the carboxylato group adopts an essentially symmetric bidentate mode with Zn–O = 2.22 and 2.16 Å, while the other is highly asymmetric with Zn–O = 1.95 and 2.89 Å (<a href="#tab4">Table 4</a>). The coordination geometry of Zn<sup>II</sup> is highly distorted from octahedral and can be described as a monocapped square pyramid: three oxygens and two nitrogens with normal Zn–O/N distances define a distorted square pyramidal environment, in which the Zn<sup>II</sup> atom is significantly displaced out of the base towards the apex (O3), and the weakly bonded oxygen is hanged over the triangular face containing two nitrogens (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>). An alternative description of the geometry is a distorted trigonal prism: one base (N⋯N⋯O) is defined by the biql nitrogens and the weakly bonded oxygen, and the other (O⋯O⋯O) by the three normally bonded oxygens. Because of the very small bite angle of the asymmetric carboxylato group, the latter base is significantly inclined relatively to the former one, and the side edge (O⋯O) defined by the asymmetric carboxylato group is inclined and much shorter relatively to the other two side edges (N⋯O).

    The zigzag chain in <strong>3</strong> contains two independent sets of centrosymmetric STDC bridges, with symmetric and asymmetric carboxylato groups, respectively, and the Zn⋯Zn separations are 17.38 and 17.61 Å. The chain exhibits the smallest corner angle (105.8°) and hence the shortest repeat period (27.90 Å) among the zigzag chains reported in this paper. The corner angle is consistent with the distorted trigonal prismatic geometry of Zn<sup>II</sup>: if two linear ligands stretched out from a basal edge and a side edge of an ideal trigonal prism, the angle between the stretching directions would be ideally 135°, but in <strong>3</strong>, the inclining of the O⋯O⋯O base and the O⋯O side edge pulls the bridging ligands closer. These geometric features of the chain in <strong>3</strong> may be attributed to the increased steric hindrance imposed by the large biql ligand on the bridging ligand.
</p><p>
    Similar to those in <strong>2</strong>, the chains in <strong>3</strong> are arranged in a corner-to-corner fashion to facilitate relatively strong interchain π–π stacking interactions between biql groups, which bristle outwards from the corners of the chains (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8(a)</a>), with an interplanar distance of 3.37 Å and a centroid–centroid distance of 3.61 Å. The resulting 2D layer can be regarded as a (6,3) net, with two long connections (the STDC ligands) and a short connection (the π–π stacked biql pair), which separate the nodes (the metal ions) by 17.38, 17.61 and 6.98 Å, respectively.

    In contrast to the parallel packing in <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong>, the zigzag chains in <strong>3</strong> propagate along two different directions, [210] and [2–10], and consequently, two equivalent sets of (6,3) layers are formed along the (1−21) and (121) planes, respectively. Because the two sets of layers are perpendicular to each other, interlocking or interpenetration occurs unavoidably, which fills the large voids in individual layers (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8(b)</a>). The inclined interpenetration leads to a 3D polycatenated network for <strong>3</strong>. Remarkably, each rhombic ring of a layer is catenated by as many as four identical rings from different layers. Ciani <em>et al</em> have recently proposed that the ‘degree of catenation’ (Doc) for infinite interlocking may be defined by the symbol (<em>a</em>/<em>b</em>, ...), where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, ... are the numbers of ‘external’ rings catenated to a single ring in different motifs.<a href="#cit21"><sup>21</sup></a> Accordingly, the 3D polycatenated network in <strong>3</strong> has Doc = (4/4), and this represents the highest catenation based on two inclined 2D motifs. The overwhelming majority of the known polycatenated species with two inclined 2D motifs have Doc = (1/1) (two-fold interpenetration), and several networks with Doc = (2/2) or (3/3) have also been reported.<a href="#cit22"><sup>22</sup></a> Only one species with Doc = (4/4) was previously described, which is based on the hydrogen-bonded 2D networks of cyclohexane-1,3<em>cis</em>-,5<em>cis</em>-tricarboxylic acid and acetonitrile.<a href="#cit23"><sup>23</sup></a> The high catenation in <strong>3</strong> is obviously related to the long and slim STDC ligand.
</p><p>
    The 3D polycatenation in <strong>3</strong> is sustained by two types of supramolecular forces between the interlocking motifs (<a href="#fig8">Fig. 8(c)</a>). One is the face-to-face π–π stacking interaction involving a pyridyl ring from biql and a phenyl ring from STDC, with the interplanar and centroid–centroid distances being 3.48 and 3.83 Å, respectively. The other is the C–H⋯O hydrogen bond involving the weakly coordinated oxygen atom and a phenyl CH group from different STDC ligands, with C14⋯O4B = 3.29 Å, H14⋯O4B = 2.39 Å; and C14–H14⋯O4B = 161.4° (B = <em>x</em>, 1.5 − <em>y</em>, 0.5 + <em>z</em>). Only the STDC ligand with asymmetrically coordinated carboxylato groups is involved in these interactions. Notably, the biql⋯biql and biql⋯phenyl π–π stacking interactions alternate along the <em>a</em> direction and associate the ligands into infinite 1D tapes, in which the biql and STDC ligands belong to zigzag chains of different propagating directions. It is reasonable to say that the extensive π–π stacking play a very important role in determining the packing of the chain.
</p><p>
    An alternative view of the overall chain packing in <strong>3</strong> is shown in <a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>. As illustrated, the chains propagating along different directions are alternately arranged in separate layers parallel to the (002) plane, and the chains in the same layer are aligned in a parallel, slipped and side-by-side fashion. While there are no evident interchain hydrogen bonding or π–π stacking interactions within each layers, the above-described biql⋯biql π–π stacking between the ligands occurs between the parallel chains from next-nearest layers, and the C–H⋯O hydrogen bonding and the biql⋯phenyl π–π stacking operate between the non-parallel chains from adjacent layers.

</span>
    </h4>
<p>
    The two compounds are isomorphous with the same microporous framework (<strong>4</strong>) and different guest molecules. The structure of <strong>4a</strong> has been briefly communicated elsewhere.<a href="#cit15"><sup>15</sup></a> Here we describe it in more details for comparison with other structures. The framework of <strong>4b</strong> shows very minor differences from that of <strong>4a</strong>.
</p><p>
    The zinc(<span class="small-caps">ii</span>) ion in <strong>4a</strong> is six-coordinated by two equivalent chelate carboxylato groups from different STDC ligands and a chelate phen ligand two equivalent pyridines and two equivalent carboxylato groups from different STDC ligands, with a two-fold axis passing Zn and bisecting the phen ligand (<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>). Similar to that in <strong>1</strong>, the carboxylato group in <strong>4a</strong> adopts a highly asymmetric bidentate mode, and the Zn–N/O bond distances (<a href="#tab5">Table 5</a>) and the Zn⋯Zn distance (17.54 Å) separated by the centrosymmetric STDC bridge are also similar. However, as expected, the N–Zn–N bite angle of the phen ligand (80.1°) in <strong>4a</strong> is much smaller than the N–Zn–N angle (106.6°) involving two pyridyl groups in <strong>1</strong>, and the O–Zn–O angle involving the two short Zn–O bonds in <strong>4a</strong> is much larger than that in <strong>1</strong> (132.0 <em>vs.</em> 98.5°), reflecting that the terminal phen ligand imposes less steric hindrance on the bridging ligands than the two separate pyridineligands. The coordination geometry in <strong>4a</strong> can be described as a distorted trigonal prism, but the distortion is much less severe than that in <strong>3</strong>, because all the three side edges of the prism in <strong>4a</strong> are defined by chelate groups (a N⋯N edge defined by phen and two equivalent O⋯O edges by carboxylates). Despite the differences in coordination geometry, the corner angle (121.3°) and the repeat period (30.58 Å) of the zigzag chain in <strong>4a</strong> are similar to those in <strong>1</strong>. The corner angle in <strong>4a</strong> is in good agreement with the coordination geometry: if two linear ligands stretched out from two side edges of an ideal trigonal prism, the angle between the stretching directions would be ideally 120°.

    In striking contrast to the chains in the preceding compounds, the chains in <strong>4a</strong> are arranged around the crystallographic four-fold axes in the [001] direction, and propagate along four non-coplanar directions ([111], [−1−11], [1−11] and [−111]), as shown in <a href="#fig11">Fig. 11(a)</a>. This unusual arrangement enables the chains to entangle in a complicated fashion (<a href="#fig11">Fig. 11(b)</a>), generating a 3D framework with open channels in the [001] direction (<a href="#fig11">Fig. 11(c)</a>).
</p><p>
    The 3D entanglement is very complicated, but it can be made clear by unravelling it into two sets of 2D entangled sheets. The chains along [1−11] and [−111] are interwoven like the warps and woofs in cloth to give a set of 2D sheets parallel to the (110) planes (<a href="#fig12">Fig. 12(a), (b)</a>). The other set of sheets are identical but formed along the (1−10) planes from the chains along the [111] and [−1−11]. The two sets of 2D sheets, perpendicular to each other, are further interlocked in a fashion that each ‘mesh’ in any sheet is threaded through by two chains from a different sheet, generating the 3D entangled framework (<a href="#fig12">Fig. 12(c)</a>). Topologically, the interlocking fashion of the interwoven sheets strongly resembles the well-documented inclined interpenetration of (4,4) coordination sheets.<a href="#cit24"><sup>24</sup></a> However, no real interpenetration has occurred here: the chains in the 2D warp-and-woof motif are not linked, and the structure can be disentangled by slipping off the chains, without breaking any chemical bonds.

    The entanglement of infinite chains with different propagating directions is still an extremely rare phenomenon. So far, the only examples have been the 2D warp-and-woof interweaving of the zigzag chains with two different propagating directions and the 3D entanglement of the (quasi-)linear chains propagating in three different directions.<a href="#cit13"><sup>13,25</sup></a> The structure of <strong>4a</strong> is unprecedented, and represents the first 3D entangled framework assembled from 1D chains in four different directions. It may be called ‘hierarchical entanglement’, because it bears both the 2D warp-and-woof interwoven feature arising from 1D zigzag chains and the 2D→3D interlocking feature resembling the inclined interpenetration of 2D nets. A unique feature of this hierarchically entangled structure is that you have to slip off at least two sets of chains, one from the (110) sheets and one from the (1−10) sheets, to fully disentangle the structure. If only the chains that belong to the same set of sheets are slipped off, the 2D warp-and-woof entanglement is retained.
</p><p>
    A remarkable consequence of the 3D entanglement in <strong>4a</strong> is the formation of 1D channels, which extend along the four-fold axes and have dimensions of <em>ca</em>. 5 × 5 Å. The channels are occupied by DMSO molecules with symmetry-imposed disorder in the methyl groups, and PLATON calculations<a href="#cit20"><sup>20</sup></a> show that the guest-accessible volume comprises 18.6% of the crystal volume (980 Å<sup>3</sup> per unit cell).
</p><p>
    The 3D entanglement in <strong>4a</strong> is sustained by extensive interchain π–π interactions involving the phen ligands and the benzene rings of the STDC ligands, with the face-to-face distance being about 3.49 Å. As shown in <a href="#fig11">Fig. 11(a)</a>, four chains around each four-fold axis are stuck together by four π–π stacking motifs to form a cyclic repeat unit for the channels. It is noted that all the aromatic rings in the structure are involved in the relatively strong π–π interactions: each phen group is sandwiched between two benzene rings from different stilbene moieties, and each benzene ring of the stilbene moiety overlaps with a phen group. Thus, the phen and stilbene groups from different 2D warp-and-woof motifs are alternately arranged to form an infinite π–π stacking array along the <em>c</em> direction (<a href="#fig12">Fig. 12(d)</a>), and each channel is surrounded by four such π–π stacking arrays.

Comparison among the STDC-bridged species
</span>
    </h3>
<p>
    With different terminal ligands, all the four structures reported here are built of zigzag chains. The zigzag topology is the result of several factors, including the geometric and electronic preferences of the metal center and the ligands. In particular, the pyridine-derived terminal ligands block two <em>cis</em> positions around the metal centers, and thus leave restricted coordination sites for the linear bridging ligands to facilitate the formation of zigzag chains. Terminal ligands impose great influences on the coordination geometry/mode of the metal ion and the bridging ligand, and hence on the shape of the zigzag chains. The Zn<sup>II</sup> ions in these compounds are all in the six-coordinative [N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>] environment, but the geometries are distinct, including distorted octahedral (<strong>2</strong>), bicapped tetrahedral (<strong>1</strong>), monocapped square pyramidal (<strong>3</strong>) and trigonal prismatic (<strong>4</strong>). These observations are a reflection of the high coordination flexibility of the Zn<sup>II</sup> ion. The linear STDC ligand also shows some degree of flexibility in that the carboxylate group can adopt different coordination modes, such as monodentate (<strong>2</strong>), symmetric bidentate (<strong>2</strong>, <strong>3</strong>) and highly asymmetric bidentate (<strong>1</strong>, <strong>4</strong>). The zigzag chains have also been shown to exhibit different corner angles, which are consistent with the differences in coordination geometry.
</p><p>
    More interesting but subtle is the packing of the zigzag chains in space, which is influenced by various interplaying factors. In particular, besides the aromatic rings and the carboxylate groups from the bridging ligand, the aromatic terminal ligands provide potential recognition sites for intermolecular interactions, and have critical impacts on the packing. In general, inspections into the present structures suggest that enhanced π-conjugation in the terminal ligands facilitates more extensive π–π stacking. In the compound with pyridine as the terminal ligand (<strong>1</strong>), no π–π stacking occurs, and instead, the weak C–H⋯O hydrogen bonding between pyridine and carboxylate assembles the chains into a diamond net with four-fold interpenetration. This leads to the parallel packing illustrated in <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>. The supramolecular structures of <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong> are featured by the pairwise π–π stacking of the terminal ligands, which tends to organize parallel chains into layers. In <strong>2</strong>, the coordinated water molecule provides an additional recognition site for interchain interactions. The bipy⋯bipy π–π stacking and the O–H(water)⋯O(carboxylate) hydrogen bonding collaborate to generate a diamond net. Because these interactions in <strong>2</strong> pull the chains closer than the hydrogen bonds in <strong>1</strong>, the void space in a single net of <strong>2</strong> is relatively smaller. As a result, only two-fold interpenetration occurs in <strong>2</strong>, and the parallel chain packing is less close than that in <strong>1</strong>. Substitution of bipy with biql leads to the new packing mode in <strong>3</strong>, in which not only biql but also half of the bridging ligands are involved in π–π stacking. While the pairwise biql⋯biql stacking tends to arrange the chains in parallel, the biql⋯stilbene stacking, in collaboration with C–H⋯O hydrogen bonds, requires that the involved chains have different orientations. The interplay of these interactions leads to a 3D architecture in which two sets of chains with different orientations are separately arranged in alternate parallel layers.
</p><p>
    The most interesting packing occurs in <strong>4</strong>. The pairwise π–π stacking of the terminal ligands, which features the structures of <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong>, is not operative in <strong>4</strong>. Instead, extensive π–π stacking interactions occur between the phen ligands and the benzene rings of the bridging ligands, leading to an unprecedented 3D architecture in which zigzag chains with four different orientations are hierarchically entangled. From the viewpoint of interchain interactions, the interwoven packing in <strong>4</strong> is very efficient, because all the aromatic rings are involved in extensive π–π stacking.
</p><p>
    It is interesting to note that a supramolecular isomer of <strong>4</strong>, [Zn(STDC)(phen)], has been reported very recently,<a href="#cit11"><sup>11</sup></a> which was hydrothermally synthesized in the presence of triethylamine. Although the polycatenated structure has been analyzed in a very different way, a careful inspection reveals that it is actually isomorphous with <strong>3</strong>. This suggests that the two structures possess comparable supramolecular association energy and that the reaction conditions, especially the solvent systems, are very important in determining the final structure.
</p><p>
    Can the 3D entanglement observed in <strong>4</strong> be generated from bipy or biql? Such kind of questions is not easy to answer. In the case of biql, a closer inspection definitely indicates that the substitution of phen with the bulkier biql ligand in the entangled structure would lead to great steric hindrance between the adjacent biql ligands from different chains. If the chains were moved away from each other to reduce the hindrance, the π–π stacking would be destroyed. In the case of bipy, the answer is not so definite. In <strong>4</strong>, the benzene ring of the phen ligand plays an important role in the phen⋯stilbene π–π stacking (ESI,<a href="#fn2" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Additional graphics for structure 4a, TGA, PXRD and IR spectra. See DOI: 10.1039/b715949h">‡</a> Fig. S1). Without the benzene ring, perhaps the π–π stacking formed by bipy is not strong enough to sustain the entanglement.

Comparison with the BDC analogues
</span>
    </h3>
<p>
    The comparison will be limited to the M<sup>II</sup>–STDC and M<sup>II</sup>–BDC zigzag coordination chains with the corners decorated by appropriate terminal ligands. It is noted that the packing of the zigzag chains reported by different authors were described in very different ways. To facilitate comparison, we have re-examined the structures and analyzed the packing by considering the net topology based on interchain interactions.
</p><p>
    The STDC ligand used in the present work differs from BDC mainly in two aspects: STDC is much longer and bears two benzene rings that are potential recognition sites. As will be seen, the differences can influence the chain packing in different ways and to different degree.
</p><p>
    With py as terminal ligand, only one zigzag chain compound, [Zn(BDC)(py)(H<sub>2</sub>O)],<a href="#cit12"><sup>12</sup></a> has been obtained from BDC, in which a coordinated water molecule takes the place of a pyridineligand in <strong>1</strong>. Although not recognized by the authors, the zigzag chains in that compound propagate in two different directions, and are associated <em>via</em> O–H(water)⋯O(carboxylate) hydrogen bonding into an unusual four-connected 6<sup>5</sup>8 net without interpenetration. Interestingly, in spite of the great differences in interchain interactions and net topology, the overall chain packing pattern in that compound is very similar to that in <strong>3</strong> (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>).
</p><p>
    With bipy as terminal ligand, two isostructural BDC compounds, [M(BDC)(bipy)]·guest (M = Ni, Zn),<a href="#cit10"><sup>10,11</sup></a> have been described. Unlike <strong>2</strong>, the chains in the two compounds have no coordinated water molecules, and hence the packing mode is different: the chains are packed in an eclipsed side-by-side fashion to form layers, and the chains from neighboring layers are arranged in the corner-to-corner fashion to facilitate extensive bipy⋯bipy π–π stacking, which gathers the bipyligands into infinite zipper-like columns. Taking the π–π stacking motifs as linkers, this packing mode corresponds to a diamond net without interpenetration.
</p><p>
    A series of zigzag chains with the general formula [M(BDC)(NN)(H<sub>2</sub>O)] (M = Cd for NN = bipy and M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn for NN = phen) have been reported by different authors.<a href="#cit8"><sup>8–10</sup></a> All these chains have a coordinated water molecule for each metal ion. The water molecule in two pseudo-polymorphous Ni<sup>II</sup> species<a href="#cit10"><sup>10</sup></a> is at the position <em>trans</em> to a phen nitrogen and hence the chains have corner angles comparable to that in <strong>2</strong>. Differently, the water molecule in the rest compounds is placed at the position <em>cis</em> to the two phen nitrogens, pressing the three carboxylate oxygens into <em>cis</em> positions, and hence the zigzag chains have much smaller corner angles (102–110°).
</p><p>
    The interchain interactions in these water-coordinated species are similar to those in <strong>2</strong>. They share the features that the chains form hydrogen-bonded layers <em>via</em> the O–H(water)⋯O(carboxylate) interactions, and that the layers interact <em>via</em> the pairwise terminal–terminal π–π stacking to generate a diamond net, in which the alternating double hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking gather the chain corners into 1D column motifs (see <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a> and <a href="#fig6">6(a)</a>). Nevertheless, the differences in packing are also significant. In the Co, Cu, Zn and Cd species with BDC, the O–H⋯O interactions involve the coordinated carboxylato oxygens as acceptors, and associate neighboring chains in the corner-to-corner fashion, as in <strong>2</strong>. This, in combination with smaller corner angles, leads to relatively large voids in the hydrogen-bonded layers, and hence two-fold interpenetration occurs to fill the void. But unlike that in <strong>2</strong>, the interpenetration in these BDC-based networks leaves no guest-accessible voids, which is the reflection of the fact that the BDC bridge is much shorter than STDC. On the other hand, the acceptor of the O–H⋯O interaction in the two Ni<sup>II</sup> species<a href="#cit10"><sup>10</sup></a> is the uncoordinated carboxylato oxygen, which is relatively far from the corner. This leads to a staggered side-by-side, instead of corner-to-corner, arrangement of the chains in the hydrogen-bonded layer. In such layers, the non-equivalent BDC bridges from neighboring chains are pulled closer to form infinite arrays <em>via</em> edge-to-face C–H⋯π contacts. Consequently, no voids are left within the layer, and no interpenetration occurs. Obviously, a staggered side-by-side arrangement of the STDC chains in layers would not allow the intralayer O–H⋯O and C–H⋯π interactions, due to the much longer length of the bridging ligand. The above comparisons clearly exemplify the influences of the bridging ligands on the chain packing.
</p><p>
    It is noted that another Ni<sup>II</sup>–BDC compound with phen, [Ni(BDC)(phen)],<a href="#cit10"><sup>10</sup></a> bears some resemblance to <strong>3</strong>. In that compound, two sets of zigzag chains with different orientations are organized <em>via</em> the pairwise π–π stacking into two sets of (6,3) layers that are polycatenated in the inclined way, as described for <strong>3</strong>. However, the degree of catenation [Doc = (2/2)] is much lower than that in <strong>3</strong>, and the polycatenation is sustained by weak C–H⋯π interactions, instead of the π–π and C–H⋯O interactions in <strong>3</strong>. These differences are obviously in good agreement with the differences between the bridging ligand.
</p><p>
    The dicarboxylate complexes with biql as terminal ligand remain largely unexplored, and only one zigzag compound, [Zn(BDC)(biql)], have been reported previously.<a href="#cit26"><sup>26</sup></a> A close review of the structure suggests that the metal environment and the corner angle (109.2°) of the chain are very similar to those found in <strong>3</strong>. The pairwise biql⋯biql π–π stacking is also operative to arrange the chains in layers, but all the layers are parallel and no polycatenation occurs. Compared with <strong>3</strong> and [Ni(BDC)(phen)], perhaps the cavities in the π–π associated layer of [Zn(BDC)(biql)] are not large enough for the chain with the large biql ligand to thread through. The overall packing mode of the chains is similar to that in <strong>2</strong>.
</p><p>
    
          No counterpart of the entangled network of <strong>4</strong> has been obtained from BDC, which is easy to understand: BDC does not have the appropriate recognition sites (two benzene rings) and length. This indicates the great difficulty in designing entanglements.

Thermal stability and guest inclusion
</span>
    </h3>
<p>
    Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) on <strong>2</strong>, <strong>4a</strong> and <strong>4b</strong> were performed (see ESI<a href="#fn2" title="Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Additional graphics for structure 4a, TGA, PXRD and IR spectra. See DOI: 10.1039/b715949h">‡</a>). Compound <strong>2</strong> exhibits a weight loss of 9.5% at 60–140 °C, corresponding to the loss of 1/2 pyridine and one H<sub>2</sub>O molecule per formula unit (calc. 10.2%), and the evacuated material is stable up to 220 °C. TGA of <strong>4a</strong> showed a weight loss of 13.8% at 60–150 °C, which corresponds to the loss of one DMSO guest molecule per formula unit (calc. 13.2%). <strong>4b</strong> releases the guest molecules in the temperature range of 50–120 °C, and the observed weight loss (4.5%) is reasonably close to calculated value (5%). The heating of both <strong>4a</strong> and <strong>4b</strong> resulted in the same apohost that is thermally stable up to 350 °C.
</p><p>
    The guest inclusion properties of <strong>2</strong> were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements (<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>). The peak positions of the measured PXRD pattern for <strong>2</strong> (<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13(b)</a>) are coincident with those of the pattern simulated from single-crystal data (<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13(a)</a>), confirming the phase purity of the sample. Although the desolvated solid of <strong>2</strong> (obtained by heating at 90 °C under vacuum for 24 h) maintains the crystalline morphology, as observed under a microscope, its PXRD pattern (<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13(c)</a>) shows different peak positions and weaker intensities compared with those of the as-synthesized sample, suggesting the occurrence of structural transformation upon evacuation. However, when the evacuated solids were immersed in a mixture of pyridine–H<sub>2</sub>O (1/3 v/v) at room temperature for 10 h, the PXRD pattern (<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13d</a>) is coincident with that for the as-synthesized sample. These observations indicate that <strong>2</strong> is a dynamic microporous material of the third generation, which undergoes structural transformation/recovery upon the removal/inclusion of guest molecules.<a href="#cit27"><sup>27</sup></a>

    The phase purity of the bulk sample of <strong>4a</strong> was also confirmed by PXRD analyses (<a href="#fig14">Fig. 14(a) and (b)</a>). Although the sample lost its single crystal nature upon evacuation at 120 °C under vacuum for 24 h, the PXRD pattern of the evacuated sample (<a href="#fig14">Fig. 14(c)</a>) exhibited only slight shifts in peak positions. Unit cell refinement using the CELREF program<a href="#cit28"><sup>28</sup></a> based on the tetragonal system leads to <em>a</em> = 16.235(8) Å, <em>c</em> = 19.174(1) Å, and <em>V</em> = 5054(2) Å<sup>3</sup>. These suggest that the entangled porous framework remains intact, with only a contraction of <em>ca.</em> 4% in cell volume. The permanent microporosity of <strong>4</strong> is confirmed by N<sub>2</sub> gas sorption studies, which revealed a reversible type I isotherm<a href="#cit29"><sup>29</sup></a> with a Langmuir surface area of 303 cm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> and an estimated pore volume of 0.12 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>.

In addition, the material exhibits consistent PXRD patterns after ten cycles of DMSO absorption/desorption, suggesting the resistance to fatigue. The reversible inclusion of DMSO is also supported by the presence/absence of the IR bands at 2930 and 1030 cm<sup>−1</sup> (marked by asterisks in <a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>), which are attributable to the C–H and S<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]">O stretching vibrations of DMSO, respectively.

    The selectivity in guest inclusion and exchange of compound <strong>4</strong> was also investigated. The DMSO and DMF guests in the materials are exchangeable: immersing <strong>4a</strong> in DMF yielded <strong>4b</strong>, and <em>vice versa.</em> But the materials do not exhibit appreciable guest adsorption or exchange when they are immersed in water, methanol and ethanol, suggesting the selectivity in guest inclusion. Furthermore, when the material (either evacuated or solvated) is immersed in a 1 : 1 (v/v) mixture of DMSO and DMF, the resulting material is always <strong>4a</strong>, suggesting that the porous framework has a preference of DMSO over DMF.

Conclusions
</span>
    </h2>
<p>
    We have described a series of Zn<sup>II</sup> compounds consisting of zigzag coordination chains with the STDC bridging ligand and systematically varied terminal ligands. The terminal ligands influence the final structures in various aspects, including the metal coordination environment, the zigzag shape, and especially the chain packing. Although it is impossible to fully rationalize the formation of a specific structure, the comparative analyses of these structures and the BDC analogues in terms of interchain interactions and net topologies have been attempted and provided some significant information.
</p><p>
    (i) The terminal⋯terminal interchain π–π stacking in most compounds and the interchain O–H(water)⋯O(carboxylate) hydrogen bonding in water-coordinated systems serve as the primary organizing force for chain packing. These corner-to-corner interactions tend to arrange the chains in parallel manners.
</p><p>
    (ii) Aromatic interactions between the terminal and bridging ligands can lead to non-parallel packing. As exemplified by the structures of <strong>3</strong>, [Zn(STDC)(phen)]<a href="#cit10"><sup>10</sup></a> and [Ni(BDC)(phen)],<a href="#cit9"><sup>9</sup></a> these corner-to-bridge interactions (π–π or CH⋯π), in collaboration with the corner-to-corner π–π stacking interactions, generate the 3D packing that two sets of chains with different orientations are separately arranged in alternate parallel layers.
</p><p>
    (iii) The differences between STDC and BDC in length and aromatic sites impose some influences on the structures. A general trend is that the packing nets in the STDC compounds have a higher degree of interpenetration or larger voids than those in the BDC analogues.
</p><p>
    (iv) Most intriguingly, in absence of corner-to-corner π–π stacking, all the aromatic groups in <strong>4</strong> are involved in corner-to-bridge π–π stacking, leading to an unprecedented 3D packing mode, in which the chains with four different orientations are hierarchically entangled. The 3D hierarchical entanglement is determined by various interplaying factors: the size of the terminal ligand, the length of the bridging ligand, the properly matched aromatic sites in the bridging ligands, the turn angle of the chains are all important in allowing the corner-to-bridge π–π stacking to operate throughout the 3D structure.
</p><p>
    Finally, combined PXRD, IR and guest desorption/adsorption studies suggest that <strong>2</strong> is a dynamic microporous material of the third generation, which undergoes reversible structural transformation/recovery upon the removal/inclusion of guest molecules, and that <strong>4</strong> is a rigid microporous material of the second generation, with the framework structure remaining intact after evacuation. The rigidity of <strong>4</strong> may be related to the extensive 3D entanglement of chains.
